**Customer Expectation:** Data and system security maintained without service impact. Compliance and regulatory acts have to be followed all the time
**Objective:** Implement security best practices while maintaining operational efficiency

### Best Practices

- Implement zero-trust security architecture
- Implement least privilege access based on the need-to-know principle
- Grant apps and functions minimal access or utilize temporary tokens
- Use automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines
- Maintain up-to-date security patches and updates
- Implement proper access controls and audit logging
- Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing
- Implement secrets management and rotation policies
- Establish incident response procedures for security events

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Security measures can impact system performance
- Compliance requirements may limit operational flexibility and introduce a need to store documents for an extended period
- Security tooling can generate false positives requiring investigation
- Regular security updates may require service disruptions

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Vulnerability Management:**
1. Implement automated vulnerability scanning
2. Establish patch management procedures
3. Prioritize vulnerabilities based on risk assessment
4. Implement security monitoring and alerting
5. Regular security training for engineering teams
