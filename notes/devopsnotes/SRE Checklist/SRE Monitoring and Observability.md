**Customer Expectation:** Key processes are visible and issues are detected before customer impact
**Objective:** Maintain comprehensive visibility into system health and performance

### Best Practices

- Implement the four golden signals: latency, traffic, errors, saturation
- Use distributed tracing for complex service interactions
- Implement structured logging with consistent schemas
- Create SLO-based alerting to reduce noise
- Use unified observability platforms when possible
- Implement custom metrics for business-specific indicators
- Establish clear escalation and notification procedures

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Excessive telemetry can impact system performance and cost
- Alert fatigue reduces response effectiveness
- Data retention policies must balance cost with investigation needs

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Alert Fatigue:**
1. Review and tune alert thresholds regularly
2. Implement alert correlation and suppression
3. Focus on SLO-based alerting over symptom-based
4. Establish clear severity levels and response procedures
5. Regularly review alert effectiveness and accuracy

**Incomplete Visibility:**
1. Implement end-to-end tracing for critical user journeys
2. Add custom metrics for business-critical operations
3. Ensure consistent logging across all services
4. Implement synthetic monitoring before real user monitoring
5. Create dashboards focused on customer impact
