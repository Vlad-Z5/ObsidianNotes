**Customer Expectation:** System can handle growth and traffic spikes without degradation
**Objective:** Ensure adequate resources exist and are ready to handle the current and projected demand

### Best Practices

- Implement usage trend analysis and forecasting models
- Align capacity planning with business growth projections
- Set up proactive alerting before resource exhaustion
- Implement automated scaling policies with appropriate headroom
- Review capacity regularly to ensure the needed amount is readily available
- Plan for seasonal and event-driven traffic patterns
- Maintain buffer capacity for unexpected demand spikes

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Over-provisioning leads to unnecessary costs
- Under-provisioning results in service degradation or outages
- Forecasting errors can have significant business impact
- Complex capacity models may be difficult to maintain and understand

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Inadequate Forecasting:**
1. Implement comprehensive usage analytics
2. Incorporate business intelligence into capacity models
3. Use machine learning for demand prediction
4. Regularly review and calibrate forecasting models
5. Establish feedback loops between actual and predicted usage
6. Inspect and analyze anomalies

**Resource Constraints:**
1. Implement early warning systems for capacity thresholds
2. Establish procurement and provisioning lead times
3. Use burst strategies for temporary capacity needs
4. Optimize resource allocation across services
5. Implement capacity sharing mechanisms where appropriate
