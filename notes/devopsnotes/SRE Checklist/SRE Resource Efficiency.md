**Customer Expectation:** Cost-effective service delivery without performance impact
**Objective:** Optimize resource utilization while maintaining service quality

### Best Practices

- Implement intelligent autoscaling based on metrics
- Maintain CPU/memory utilization in the 50-70% range during normal operations
- Use saving offerings strategically and plan for the expected near future
- Implement resource right-sizing based on actual usage patterns
- Monitor and optimize costs regularly
- Use container orchestration for efficient resource allocation
- Implement workload scheduling for non-critical tasks

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Aggressive cost optimization may impact reliability during traffic spikes
- Complex autoscaling rules can introduce unpredictable behavior
- Over-optimization can reduce development velocity
- Cost constraints may limit disaster recovery and high availability capabilities

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Resource Waste:**
1. Analyze resource utilization patterns over time
2. Identify idle resources that may be removed without any negative impact
3. Implement automated resource scaling policies
4. Schedule non-critical workloads during off-peak hours
5. Optimize container resource requests and limits
6. Regularly review and cleanup unused resources

**Inefficient Scaling:**
1. Analyze scaling triggers and thresholds
2. Implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns
3. Optimize application startup and shutdown times
4. Use appropriate scaling metrics beyond CPU usage
5. Test scaling policies under various load scenarios
