**Customer Expectation:** System handles expected load without degradation or crashes
**Objective:** Maintain throughput and response quality under peak conditions

### Best Practices

- Conduct realistic heavy load testing as part of CI/CD pipeline
- Implement horizontal scaling out and in capabilities for times when the service is over- or underutilized
- Use performance profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Optimize resource utilization patterns
- Implement queue-based processing for complex or heavy workloads
- Design for linear scalability where possible
- Establish performance baselines and regression testing

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Premature optimization wastes engineering resources
- Performance optimization often increases operational complexity, management overhead, and costs
- Scale testing environments may not reflect production accurately
- Performance improvements may conflict with other reliability goals

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**CPU Saturation:**
1. Profile application to identify hot code paths
2. Optimize algorithms and data structures
3. Implement caching for compute-intensive operations
4. Consider vertical scaling for CPU-bound workloads
5. Distribute processing across multiple nodes
6. Consider adding queues, splitting code, batching or refactoring

**Memory Leaks:**
1. Implement memory profiling and monitoring
2. Have a robust object lifecycle management
3. Optimize garbage collection settings
4. Fix memory leaks in application code
5. Set appropriate memory limits
