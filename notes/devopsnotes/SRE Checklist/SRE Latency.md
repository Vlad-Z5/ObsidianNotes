**Customer Expectation:** 10-Milisecond-level response time for all user interactions
**Objective:** Maintain consistent response times under varying load conditions

### Best Practices

- Define latency SLOs at 95th, 99th, and 99.9th percentiles
- Implement comprehensive caching strategies (application, database, CDN)
- Use connection pooling and keep-alive connections
- Optimize database queries and implement proper indexing, use caches
- Implement request hedging and intelligent retry mechanisms
- Use geographically distributed infrastructure
- Profile applications regularly to identify performance bottlenecks

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Aggressive caching can lead to data consistency issues
- Complex optimization efforts may yield diminishing returns
- Over-optimization can increase system complexity, cost, and maintenance unnecessarily
- Tail latency optimization may require significant resource investment

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Database Performance:**
1. Analyze slow query logs and execution plans
2. Implement proper indexing strategies
3. Utilize read replicas for read-heavy workloads, active replicas for write workloads
4. Implement query result caching
5. Optimize connection pooling configurations

**Network Latency:**
1. Implement CDN for static content delivery
2. Use compression or separate data in chunks for data transfer
3. Optimize API payload sizes
4. Consider regional service deployment
5. Implement intelligent load balancing based on geographic proximity
