**Customer Expectation:** New features and fixes delivered safely without service disruption
**Objective:** Enable rapid, safe deployment of improvements while maintaining system stability

### Best Practices

- Implement GitOps workflows with automated testing
- Use progressive delivery techniques (e.g. canary or blue-green deployments, A/B testing)
- Implement comprehensive feature flagging systems
- Establish clear rollback procedures and criteria
- Conduct blameless post-mortems
- Implement automated security and compliance checks
- Maintain comprehensive change documentation and approval processes

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Overutilizing error budget to a point of breaching availability SLO is never acceptable
- Rigorous change processes can slow urgent fixes
- Automation complexity may hide deployment issues
- Feature flags can accumulate technical debt
- Rollback procedures must be tested regularly to remain effective

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Slow Deployment Pipeline:**
1. Parallelize testing and build processes
2. Optimize container image sizes and layers
3. Implement intelligent test selection
4. Use deployment automation tools
5. Reduce manual approval gates where safe

**Failed Deployments:**
1. Implement comprehensive pre-deployment testing
2. Use staged deployment environments
3. Implement automated rollback triggers
4. Improve deployment monitoring and alerting
5. Conduct regular deployment process reviews and postmortems
