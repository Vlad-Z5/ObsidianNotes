**Customer Expectation:** Quick resolution of service issues with minimal customer impact
**Objective:** Minimize Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) through effective incident response

### Best Practices

- Maintain up-to-date runbooks and playbooks for common scenarios
- Implement automated incident detection and initial response
- Establish clear on-call rotations with appropriate staffing levels
- Conduct regular incident response training and simulations
- Implement war rooms and communication protocols
- Maintain post-incident review processes with action items
- Use incident management tools for tracking and coordination

### Trade-offs and Risks

- Too many on-call responsibilities will lead to engineer burnout
- Over-reliance on automation will miss edge cases
- Incident resolution may be delayed due to approval procedures
- Complex incident response procedures can involve too much human effort and slow resolution
- Inadequate handoff procedures between on-call shifts

### Common Bottlenecks and Resolution Steps

**Long Detection Time:**
1. Implement proactive monitoring and alerting, focusing on project indicators rather than nice-to-haves
2. Use synthetic monitoring for detection before the first user experiences the incident
3. Improve alert routing and escalation procedures
4. Implement automated health checks
5. Train team members on early warning signs

**Slow Resolution:**
1. Maintain current and tested runbooks
2. Implement automated remediation for common issues
3. Practice incident response through game days
4. Improve diagnostic tools and dashboards
5. Establish clear escalation procedures
