# Communication Breakdown: The Silo Problem Crisis

## The Blame Game Disaster: When Teams Become Enemies

**The Challenge:** When HealthTech's API goes down, the development team blames infrastructure while operations points to recent code changes. It takes 6 hours to coordinate response across 3 teams because nobody understands the other's constraints and priorities. The postmortem reveals that neither team knew about each other's planned changes, and both teams were working on the same problem with different solutions.

**Core Challenges:**
- 6-hour incident response time due to coordination overhead across 3 separate teams with conflicting priorities
- Development and operations teams have conflicting goals (speed vs stability) leading to blame cycles
- Critical system knowledge siloed in individual experts creating bus factor of 1 for incident response
- No shared tooling or processes making collaboration difficult and error-prone
