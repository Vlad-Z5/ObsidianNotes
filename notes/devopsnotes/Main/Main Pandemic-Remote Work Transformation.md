# Pandemic/Remote Work Transformation: The Distributed Operations Crisis

## The Emergency Remote Transition: When Physical Becomes Virtual Overnight

**The Challenge:** SuddenRemote had to transition 500 employees from on-premises development to remote work in 48 hours due to pandemic lockdowns. Their VPN infrastructure supports only 50 concurrent users, development environments are only accessible from the office, and security policies assume physical access controls.
