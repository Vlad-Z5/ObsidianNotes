# Acquisition Integration: The Corporate Merger Technology Crisis

## The Technology Stack Collision: When Two Companies Become One

**The Challenge:** AcquirerCorp just acquired TechTarget for $500M, but integration is a nightmare. AcquirerCorp uses .NET/SQL Server/Azure while TechTarget uses Java/PostgreSQL/AWS.
