# Performance & Scalability Engineering

## The Traffic Spike Catastrophe: When Success Kills Your System

**The Challenge:** StreamingCorp's Black Friday campaign goes viral, increasing traffic from 10,000 to 500,000 concurrent users within 2 hours. Their application crashes completely at 50,000 users, database connections exhaust at 15,000 users, and the CDN can't handle the media load. Revenue loss reaches $2M per hour while the system remains down, and recovery takes 6 hours because scaling procedures are entirely manual.

**Core Challenges:**

## The Memory Leak Mystery: When Performance Dies Slowly

**The Challenge:** DataProcessor's application starts fast but degrades over 48-72 hours until response times increase from 100ms to 15 seconds.

## The Concurrent User Scaling Failure: When Many Becomes Impossible

**The Challenge:** CollabTool supports 100 simultaneous users perfectly but fails catastrophically at 1,000 users with connection timeouts, resource exhaustion, and complete system unavailability.
