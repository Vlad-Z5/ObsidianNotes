# Change Management & Risk Assessment: Enterprise Change Control & Risk Mitigation

> **Domain:** Risk Management | **Tier:** Critical Governance | **Impact:** Operational stability and business continuity

## Overview
Change management and risk assessment ensure organizational stability while enabling necessary evolution through systematic evaluation, coordination, and control of modifications to technology systems. Effective change management balances innovation velocity with operational risk through structured assessment, coordinated implementation, and comprehensive rollback capabilities.

## The Deployment Chaos Crisis: When Changes Become Russian Roulette

**Case:** TechCorp, a $500M e-commerce platform serving 3.2M customers across North America, operates with a chaotic change management approach that treats every deployment like gambling with their business. Their 47-person engineering organization deploys an average of 15 changes weekly across production systems with no formal impact assessment, coordination process, or risk evaluation. Changes are initiated through casual Slack messages ("deploying the new payment API at 2 PM"), approved by whoever happens to be online, and executed with no consideration for system interdependencies or business impact timing. The chaos reaches a breaking point during Black Friday week when Senior Database Engineer Kevin Martinez decides to "quickly optimize" their user authentication table schema during peak shopping hours (3:47 PM EST on Thursday). His "minor" database modification - adding an index to improve login performance - triggers a cascade failure: the schema change locks the authentication table for 12 minutes, preventing all customer logins; dependent microservices begin failing health checks and restart continuously; the payment processing system crashes when authentication timeouts exhaust connection pools; the entire e-commerce platform becomes inaccessible for 3.5 hours during their highest-revenue period. Meanwhile, the mobile team simultaneously deploys their new checkout flow (without coordination), the infrastructure team applies security patches to load balancers, and the analytics team pushes updated tracking code - creating a perfect storm of conflicting changes with no rollback plan. The total cost: $2.3M in lost revenue, 847 customer service complaints, and emergency weekend work to untangle the overlapping changes.
