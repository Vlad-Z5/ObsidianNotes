# Compliance and Security Debt: The Legal Time Bomb Crisis

## The Regulatory Debt Avalanche: When Shortcuts Become Legal Liability

**The Challenge:** DebtRegulation has accumulated 5 years of regulatory shortcuts across GDPR, SOX, HIPAA, and PCI-DSS requirements. They have 47 known compliance gaps, 23 unpatched security vulnerabilities marked as "accepted risk," and audit trails that are incomplete or stored in 12 different systems. A regulatory audit is scheduled in 6 months, and fixing all issues would require 18 months and $3M. The accumulated compliance debt threatens their operating licenses and could result in $50M in fines.

## The Security Control Decay: When Protection Systems Degrade Over Time

**The Challenge:** ControlDecay implemented comprehensive security controls 3 years ago, but they've degraded through configuration drift, software updates, and personnel changes. Password policies aren't enforced consistently, firewall rules have accumulated exceptions, and access controls have been bypassed for "temporary" business needs that became permanent.

## The Access Control Chaos: When Identity Management Becomes Unmanageable

**The Challenge:** AccessMess has 15,000 user accounts, 50,000 permissions, and no systematic access review process. Former employees still have active accounts, contractors have permanent access to sensitive systems, and privilege escalation happens through email requests without validation.
