# DevOps Lifecycle & Methodologies

## DevOps Lifecycle Phases
The continuous cycle that integrates development and operations activities throughout the software delivery process.

### Plan
- Requirements gathering and prioritization
- Sprint planning and story mapping
- Architecture and design decisions
- Risk assessment and capacity planning

### Develop
- Code development and peer reviews
- Test-driven development practices
- Version control and branching strategies
- Static code analysis and security scanning

### Build
- Automated compilation and packaging
- Dependency management and artifact creation
- Code quality gates and compliance checks
- Build optimization and caching strategies

### Test
- Automated testing pipelines (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- Performance and security testing
- Test environment provisioning
- Test data management and synthetic testing

### Deploy
- Infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Blue-green and canary deployment patterns
- Feature flags and progressive rollouts
- Rollback mechanisms and deployment verification

### Monitor
- Application and infrastructure monitoring
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Performance metrics and alerting
- User experience and business metrics

## Methodologies Integration
- **Agile**: Iterative development with frequent feedback loops
- **Lean**: Waste elimination and continuous improvement focus
- **Site Reliability Engineering**: Service reliability and performance standards
- **Value Stream Mapping**: End-to-end process optimization
- **Theory of Constraints**: Bottleneck identification and resolution

## Feedback Loops
- Continuous integration feedback (minutes)
- Deployment pipeline feedback (hours)
- Production monitoring feedback (real-time)
- Customer feedback integration (days/weeks)
- Business metric analysis (weeks/months)
