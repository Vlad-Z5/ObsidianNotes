# DevOps Lifecycle & Methodologies

## The Linear Lifecycle Trap: When Stages Become Silos

**The Challenge:** LinearTech follows a strict Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor sequence, treating each phase as a separate gate that must be completely finished before the next begins. When a security vulnerability is discovered in production, it takes 6 weeks to cycle back through all phases. Teams optimize their individual stages while the overall delivery time stretches to 8 months per feature.

**Core Challenges:**
