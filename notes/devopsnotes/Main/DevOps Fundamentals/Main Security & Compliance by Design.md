# Security & Compliance by Design

## The Security Afterthought Catastrophe: When Protection Comes Too Late

**The Challenge:** ReactiveBank builds their entire mobile banking platform and only considers security during the final month before launch. The security team discovers 847 vulnerabilities, including hardcoded API keys, unencrypted customer data transmission, and admin panels accessible without authentication. The launch is delayed 8 months while security issues are retrofitted, costing $12M in lost revenue and regulatory fines.

**Core Challenges:**
- Security consideration postponed until final month before launch requiring complete system redesign

**Success Indicators:** Security vulnerabilities decrease 95% through early integration; time-to-market improves despite security requirements; regulatory compliance achieved without launch delays

## The Compliance Theater Performance: When Documentation Replaces Security

**The Challenge:** CheckboxCorp has perfect compliance documentation, detailed security policies, and passes all audits with flying colors. However, developers routinely bypass security controls using shared admin accounts, production secrets are stored in Slack channels, and actual security practices bear no resemblance to documented procedures. The audit findings show 100% compliance while real security posture is abysmal.

**Core Challenges:**

**Success Indicators:** Gap between documented and actual security practices eliminates; real security posture improves alongside compliance metrics; security incidents decrease despite reduced documentation overhead

## The Shared Secret Disaster: When Convenience Kills Security

**The Challenge:** EasyAccess has one shared admin password ("Admin123!") used across 15 different systems by 47 team members. The password is written on sticky notes, shared in team chat rooms, and stored in Excel spreadsheets.
