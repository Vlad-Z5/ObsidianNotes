# Security & Compliance by Design

## Security-First Philosophy
Security and compliance must be integrated throughout the software development lifecycle rather than treated as afterthoughts. This shift-left approach reduces risk and compliance costs.

## DevSecOps Integration
- **Security as Code**: Security policies and controls version-controlled and automated
- **Continuous Security Testing**: Automated vulnerability scanning and penetration testing
- **Threat Modeling**: Systematic identification of security risks during design phase
- **Security Champions**: Distributed security expertise across development teams
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify security model

## Compliance by Design
- **Regulatory Awareness**: Understanding applicable standards (SOX, GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS)
- **Control Automation**: Automated evidence collection and compliance reporting
- **Audit Readiness**: Continuous compliance monitoring and documentation
- **Policy as Code**: Automated enforcement of compliance requirements
- **Risk-Based Approach**: Focus on high-impact compliance requirements

## Security Practices
- **Identity and Access Management**: Principle of least privilege and role-based access
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit, data classification
- **Secret Management**: Centralized credential storage and rotation
- **Vulnerability Management**: Continuous scanning and remediation workflows
- **Incident Response**: Security event detection, response, and recovery procedures

## Architectural Security Patterns
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers and controls
- **Secure by Default**: Security-first configuration and deployment patterns
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Reduce attack surface through infrastructure immutability
- **Microservices Security**: Service-to-service authentication and authorization
- **API Security**: Rate limiting, authentication, and input validation

## Risk Management
- **Risk Assessment**: Regular evaluation of security and compliance risks
- **Risk Mitigation**: Systematic approach to reducing identified risks
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Understanding consequences of security incidents
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection and response
- **Third-Party Risk**: Vendor security assessment and supply chain security

## Cultural Transformation
- **Security Awareness**: Regular training and security mindset development
- **Shared Responsibility**: Security ownership across all team members
- **Blameless Security**: Learning from security incidents without blame
- **Security Metrics**: Measuring and improving security posture continuously
