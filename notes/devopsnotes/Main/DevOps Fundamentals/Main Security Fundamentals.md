# Security Fundamentals

## Security by Design Principles

**Defense in Depth Strategy:**
Implement multiple layers of security controls rather than relying on a single defense mechanism. Network security, application security, data encryption, and access controls work together to create comprehensive protection.

**Principle of Least Privilege:**
Grant users and systems only the minimum permissions required to perform their functions. Regularly audit and review permissions, implementing just-in-time access where appropriate.

**Zero Trust Architecture:**
- **Never Trust, Always Verify:** Authenticate and authorize every request
- **Network Micro-Segmentation:** Limit lateral movement within networks
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time threat detection and response
- **Identity-Centric Security:** User and device identity as security perimeter

**Secure Development Lifecycle:**
Integrate security considerations throughout the development process, from design through deployment and maintenance. Include threat modeling, security testing, and code reviews.

## Identity and Access Management

**Authentication Mechanisms:**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Something you know, have, and are
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Centralized authentication across applications
- **Certificate-Based Authentication:** PKI infrastructure for strong identity
- **Biometric Authentication:** Fingerprint, face recognition, or retina scanning

**Authorization Patterns:**

```json
// Example RBAC policy structure
{
  "user": "john.doe@company.com",
  "roles": ["developer", "team-lead"],
  "permissions": {
    "repositories": {
      "read": ["team-project/*", "shared-libraries/*"],
      "write": ["team-project/backend", "team-project/frontend"],
      "admin": ["team-project/config"]
    },
    "environments": {
      "deploy": ["development", "staging"],
      "monitor": ["development", "staging", "production"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Privileged Access Management:**
- **Just-in-Time Access:** Temporary elevation for specific tasks
- **Session Recording:** Audit trails for privileged operations
- **Approval Workflows:** Multi-person authorization for critical changes
- **Automated Rotation:** Regular credential updates and distribution

## Cryptography and Data Protection

**Encryption Implementation:**
- **Data at Rest:** AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Data in Transit:** TLS 1.3 for network communications
- **Data in Use:** Homomorphic encryption for processing encrypted data
- **Key Management:** Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key protection

**Digital Signatures and Certificates:**
Implement code signing for software integrity, certificate pinning for API security, and certificate lifecycle management for automated renewal and deployment.

**Hashing and Integrity:**
Use SHA-256 or stronger algorithms for data integrity verification. Implement HMAC for authenticated hashing and merkle trees for large dataset verification.

## Network Security

**Network Segmentation:**
- **DMZ Architecture:** Isolated zones for public-facing services
- **VLAN Separation:** Logical network isolation
- **Firewall Rules:** Layer 3/4 traffic filtering
- **Application Layer Gateways:** Layer 7 inspection and filtering

**Intrusion Detection and Prevention:**
Deploy network-based and host-based intrusion detection systems. Implement behavioral analysis for anomaly detection and automated response to security incidents.

**VPN and Remote Access:**
- **Site-to-Site VPN:** Secure network interconnection
- **Remote Access VPN:** Secure employee connectivity
- **Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA):** Application-specific access without network access
- **Bastion Hosts:** Secure gateway for administrative access

## Application Security

**Input Validation and Sanitization:**
Validate all inputs against defined schemas and whitelist allowed characters. Implement proper output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

**SQL Injection Prevention:**

```python
# Secure parameterized query example
import psycopg2

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    conn = psycopg2.connect(DATABASE_URL)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    
    # Safe parameterized query
    cursor.execute(
        "SELECT id, username, email FROM users WHERE id = %s",
        (user_id,)
    )
    
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    cursor.close()
    conn.close()
    return result
```

**Session Management:**
Implement secure session tokens with proper expiration, secure cookie flags, and session invalidation. Use CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Security Headers:**
- **Content Security Policy:** Prevent XSS and data injection
- **Strict Transport Security:** Force HTTPS connections
- **X-Frame-Options:** Prevent clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevent MIME type sniffing

## Infrastructure Security

**Container Security:**
- **Image Scanning:** Vulnerability assessment of container images
- **Runtime Protection:** Monitor container behavior for anomalies
- **Network Policies:** Control inter-container communication
- **Secrets Management:** Secure injection of credentials and keys

**Cloud Security Fundamentals:**
- **Identity and Access Management:** Cloud-native IAM services
- **Resource Isolation:** Virtual private clouds and security groups
- **Compliance:** SOC 2, ISO 27001, and regulatory requirements
- **Shared Responsibility Model:** Understanding cloud provider vs customer responsibilities

**Infrastructure as Code Security:**
Scan IaC templates for security misconfigurations, implement policy as code for compliance, and use least privilege principles in infrastructure definitions.

## Incident Response and Recovery

**Security Incident Management:**
- **Detection:** Automated monitoring and alerting systems
- **Analysis:** Threat investigation and impact assessment
- **Containment:** Isolate affected systems to prevent spread
- **Recovery:** Restore systems and validate security posture

**Forensic Procedures:**
Preserve evidence, maintain chain of custody, and document all investigation activities. Use forensic tools to analyze compromised systems and determine attack vectors.

**Business Continuity Planning:**
- **Backup Strategies:** Regular, tested backups with offsite storage
- **Disaster Recovery:** Documented procedures for system restoration
- **Communication Plans:** Stakeholder notification and updates
- **Lessons Learned:** Post-incident analysis and improvement

## Compliance and Risk Management

**Regulatory Compliance:**
- **GDPR:** Data protection and privacy requirements
- **HIPAA:** Healthcare information security standards
- **PCI DSS:** Payment card industry security requirements
- **SOX:** Financial reporting controls and procedures

**Risk Assessment Framework:**
Identify assets, threats, and vulnerabilities. Calculate risk scores based on likelihood and impact. Implement risk mitigation strategies and regular reassessment cycles.

**Security Metrics and KPIs:**
- **Mean Time to Detection (MTTD):** Speed of threat identification
- **Mean Time to Response (MTTR):** Speed of incident response
- **Vulnerability Management:** Time to patch critical vulnerabilities
- **Security Training:** Employee awareness and compliance rates

## DevSecOps Integration

**Shift Left Security:**
Integrate security tools and practices early in the development lifecycle. Include static analysis, dependency scanning, and security testing in CI/CD pipelines.

**Automated Security Testing:**
- **SAST:** Static Application Security Testing in code repositories
- **DAST:** Dynamic Application Security Testing in deployed environments
- **IAST:** Interactive Application Security Testing during runtime
- **SCA:** Software Composition Analysis for third-party dependencies

**Security as Code:**
Define security policies, configurations, and compliance requirements as code. Version control security definitions and automate enforcement across environments.
