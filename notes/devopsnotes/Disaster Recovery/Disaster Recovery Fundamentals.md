# Disaster Recovery Fundamentals

**Disaster Recovery Fundamentals** establish the foundation for business continuity through comprehensive planning, risk assessment, and recovery strategies that minimize downtime and data loss during catastrophic events.

## Core Concepts and Definitions

### Business Continuity vs Disaster Recovery

#### Key Differences
```
Business Continuity (BC)
├── Proactive planning for operations continuity
├── Encompasses entire business operations
├── Includes people, processes, and technology
└── Focuses on maintaining business functions

Disaster Recovery (DR)
├── Reactive response to specific incidents
├── Focuses on technology and data recovery
├── Subset of business continuity planning
└── Emphasizes restoration of IT systems
```

#### Recovery Metrics
**Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: Maximum acceptable time to restore services
**Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time
**Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD)**: Absolute maximum time before business failure
**Work Recovery Time (WRT)**: Time to verify and validate recovered systems

### Disaster Classifications

#### Natural Disasters
- **Earthquakes**: Seismic events causing infrastructure damage
- **Floods**: Water damage to facilities and equipment
- **Hurricanes/Storms**: Wind and water damage, power outages
- **Wildfires**: Fire damage and evacuation requirements
- **Extreme Weather**: Ice storms, heat waves, extreme cold

#### Human-Caused Disasters
- **Cyberattacks**: Ransomware, DDoS attacks, data breaches
- **Terrorism**: Physical or cyber terrorism events
- **Sabotage**: Internal or external malicious activities
- **Human Error**: Accidental deletion, configuration errors
- **Labor Strikes**: Workforce disruptions

#### Technology Disasters
- **Hardware Failures**: Server crashes, storage failures, network outages
- **Software Failures**: Application crashes, OS corruption, database corruption
- **Power Outages**: Electrical grid failures, UPS failures
- **Telecommunications Failures**: Internet outages, phone system failures
- **Cloud Provider Outages**: AWS, Azure, GCP service disruptions

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

#### Critical Business Functions Inventory
```
Function Assessment Matrix:
┌─────────────────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│ Business Function   │ Critical │ Important│ Moderate │ Low      │
├─────────────────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│ Customer Orders     │    ✓     │          │          │          │
│ Payment Processing  │    ✓     │          │          │          │
│ Inventory Mgmt      │          │    ✓     │          │          │
│ HR Systems          │          │          │    ✓     │          │
│ Marketing Tools     │          │          │          │    ✓     │
└─────────────────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘

Impact Timeframes:
- 0-4 hours: Critical functions must be restored
- 4-24 hours: Important functions recovery window
- 1-7 days: Moderate functions acceptable downtime
- 7+ days: Low priority functions recovery timeframe
```
