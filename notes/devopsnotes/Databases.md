## Database Theory & Fundamentals

### ACID Properties

**Atomicity** - Transactions are all-or-nothing operations. Either all changes within a transaction are committed, or none are applied. Critical for maintaining data integrity during complex operations like financial transfers.

**Consistency** - Database remains in a valid state after each transaction. All defined rules, constraints, and triggers must be satisfied. Prevents invalid data states that could corrupt business logic.

**Isolation** - Concurrent transactions don't interfere with each other. Multiple users can work simultaneously without seeing incomplete or inconsistent data from other transactions.

**Durability** - Once committed, changes persist even after system failures. Data is safely stored to non-volatile storage and survives crashes, power outages, or hardware failures.

### BASE Properties

**Basically Available** - System remains operational even during partial failures. Prioritizes availability over consistency in distributed systems.

**Soft State** - Data consistency isn't guaranteed at all times. System may be in an inconsistent state temporarily while updates propagate.

**Eventual Consistency** - System will become consistent over time once all updates have propagated. Common in distributed NoSQL systems like DynamoDB.

### CAP Theorem

**Consistency** - All nodes see the same data simultaneously. Strong consistency ensures immediate data coherence across distributed systems.

**Availability** - System remains operational and responsive. Users can always read and write data even during network partitions.

**Partition Tolerance** - System continues to operate despite network failures between nodes. Essential for distributed database architectures.

**DevOps Implication**: Must choose two of three properties. Most cloud databases offer tunable consistency levels to balance these trade-offs based on application requirements.

## Backup & Recovery Strategies

### Backup Types

**Logical Backup** - Exports database structure and data as SQL statements. Portable across different database versions and platforms. Tools include `pg_dump`, `mysqldump`.

**Physical Backup** - Copies actual database files and transaction logs. Faster for large databases but platform-specific. Examples include filesystem snapshots and binary backups.

**Incremental Backup** - Captures only changes since last backup. Reduces storage requirements and backup time. Requires careful chain management for restoration.

**Full Backup** - Complete database copy at a point in time. Foundation for all recovery scenarios but resource-intensive for large databases.

**Snapshots** - Point-in-time copies of database volumes. Cloud providers offer automated snapshot scheduling with configurable retention policies.

### Recovery Strategies

**Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)** - Restore database to any specific moment. Combines full backups with transaction log replay. Critical for minimizing data loss after corruption or user errors.

**Warm Standby** - Continuously updated backup server ready for quick activation. Reduces recovery time but requires additional infrastructure and synchronization.

**Read Replica** - Asynchronously updated copy used for read scaling and disaster recovery. Can be promoted to primary during failures.

**Failover Replica** - Synchronously updated standby for automatic failover. Provides zero data loss but may impact primary performance.

### High Availability Architectures

**Multi-AZ Deployment** - Database instances across multiple availability zones. Automatic failover during infrastructure failures with minimal downtime.

**Multi-Region Deployment** - Global database distribution for disaster recovery and reduced latency. Requires careful consideration of consistency models and data governance.

**Replication** - Data synchronization between database instances. Synchronous replication ensures consistency while asynchronous provides better performance.
