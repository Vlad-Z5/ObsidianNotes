**Core Principles:** Container orchestration platform, declarative configuration, desired state management, immutable infrastructure, microservices architecture, cloud-native applications

Why kubernetes rather than docker swarm? - Kubernetes is more robust, scalable, community supported technology, that has more extensive networking, storage and security options with multi-cloud support. Containers are ephemeral, so labels are much more suited than constraints in terms of service discovery; Docker won't know what to restart/heal after failure
