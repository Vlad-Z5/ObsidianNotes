# Docker DevOps Mastery

**Core Principles:** Containerizes applications with dependencies, shares OS kernel (lighter than VMs), immutable images with writable container layers, registry-based distribution, copy-on-write filesystem, union filesystem (OverlayFS/AUFS)

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Path

### **Foundation Level**
- **[[Docker fundamental]]** - Core concepts, architecture, client-server model, and container fundamentals
- **[[Dockerfile]]** - Complete Dockerfile guide with multi-stage builds, best practices, and optimization
- **[[Docker Commands]]** - Comprehensive CLI reference with advanced options and DevOps automation

### **Infrastructure & Operations**
- **[[Docker Networking]]** - Network types, service discovery, multi-host networking, and troubleshooting
- **[[Docker Storage & Volumes Internals]]** - Volume management, storage drivers, data persistence, and performance
- **[[Docker Security]]** - Container hardening, image scanning, secrets management, and runtime security
- **[[Docker Registry & Distribution]]** - Private registries, Harbor, cloud services, and enterprise distribution

### **Production & DevOps**
- **[[Docker Compose Production Setup]]** - Production orchestration, multi-environment patterns, and monitoring
- **[[Docker Performance & Monitoring]]** - Resource management, optimization, observability, and debugging
- **[[Docker Troubleshooting]]** - Comprehensive debugging, error resolution, and production issue diagnosis
- **[[Docker CICD]]** - GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins, Azure DevOps, and deployment strategies

## ðŸš€ DevOps Focus Areas

**Container Development:** Dockerfile optimization, multi-stage builds, image layering and caching
**Production Operations:** Compose orchestration, security hardening, performance monitoring
**CI/CD Integration:** Automated builds, testing, security scanning, and deployment pipelines
**Infrastructure:** Networking, storage, service discovery, and container orchestration

## ðŸ“Š Optimization Results

**Content Consolidation:**
- **Eliminated 3 redundant files** (Multi-Stage Build, Image Layers & Caching, Architecture & Internals)
- **Enhanced remaining 10 files** with focused, production-ready content
- **Zero duplication** across command references and examples

**DevOps Integration:**
- **Multi-platform builds** with advanced BuildKit features
- **Production security patterns** with AppArmor, Seccomp, and secrets management
- **CI/CD pipeline examples** for all major platforms (GitHub, GitLab, Jenkins, Azure)
- **Performance optimization** with resource management and monitoring
- **Cross-file references** for seamless workflow-based learning
