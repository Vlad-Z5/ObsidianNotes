**Core Principles:** Enterprise-grade DevOps architecture focusing on scalability, reliability, security, and operational excellence across cloud-native platforms and traditional infrastructure.

## Infrastructure
### [[Architect Multi-cloud / hybrid networking patterns (AWS–GCP, AWS–Azure, private cloud integration)]]
### [[Architect Account/Project/Org structure for isolation, governance, and cost allocation]]
### [[Architect VPC design (subnets, routing, transit gateways, private endpoints)]]
### [[Architect DR patterns (active-active, active-passive, backup/restore)]]
### [[Architect IaC design standards (Terraform/Pulumi modules, state management, drift detection)]]
### [[Architect Auto-scaling patterns (infra and application layers)]]
### [[Architect Immutable infrastructure practices (golden AMIs/images, container baselines)]]

## Kubernetes
### [[Architect Multi-tenant cluster architecture & workload isolation (RBAC, quotas, node pools)]]
### [[Architect Cluster lifecycle management (upgrades, patching, node replacement)]]
### [[Architect Service mesh patterns (mTLS, routing, observability)]]
### [[Architect Admission controls (OPA/Gatekeeper/Kyverno)]]
### [[Architect Namespace and resource quota strategy]]
### [[Architect Secure ingress/egress patterns (WAF, egress control, mTLS)]]
### [[Architect Zero-downtime deployments (rolling, blue-green, canary)]]

## CICD
### [[Architect Standardized pipeline templates for all teams]]
### [[Architect GitOps flows (ArgoCD, Flux) and their security implications]]
### [[Architect Automated testing integration (unit, integration, performance)]]
### [[Architect Secrets management in pipelines (Vault, External Secrets)]]
### [[Architect Artifact management (signing, provenance, SBOM)]]
### [[Architect Canary and feature-flag rollouts]]
### [[Architect Rollback and release freeze procedures]]

## Observability
### [[Architect Logging/metrics/tracing architecture (ELK/EFK, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry)]]
### [[Architect SLO/SLI/SLA definition & enforcement]]
### [[Architect Alerting rules with actionable runbooks]]
### [[Architect Distributed tracing and service dependency maps]]
### [[Architect Chaos engineering practice in staging]]
### [[Architect Capacity and performance testing pipelines]]

## Security
### [[Architect IAM best practices (least privilege, JIT access, federated SSO)]]
### [[Architect Network segmentation and microsegmentation (NetworkPolicies, firewalls)]]
### [[Architect Supply chain security (SLSA, sigstore, container scanning)]]
### [[Architect Compliance automation (CIS, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI)]]
### [[Architect Runtime security (Falco, Sysdig, Aqua)]]
### [[Architect Data encryption at rest & in transit]]
### [[Architect Audit logging and immutable log storage]]

## Operations
### [[Architect Incident management process (on-call, RCA, postmortems)]]
### [[Architect Change management (approvals, phased rollouts)]]
### [[Architect Backup/restore validation (frequency, retention, tested restores)]]
### [[Architect Config management baseline (OS hardening, patching schedule)]]
### [[Architect Node and workload health remediation automation]]
### [[Architect Disaster recovery testing schedule & reporting]]

## Leadership
### [[Architect Developer self-service platform with guardrails]]
### [[Architect Documentation and internal training programs]]
### [[Architect Communication of SLO tradeoffs to leadership]]
### [[Architect Cross-team design reviews and alignment meetings]]
### [[Architect Vendor/tool evaluation and ROI assessment]]
### [[Architect Mentorship plan for DevOps/SRE engineers]]
### [[Architect Conflict resolution between speed and safety]]

## Cost
### [[Architect Cost visibility dashboards per team/project]]
### [[Architect Auto-scaling and scheduling for cost optimization]]
### [[Architect Use of spot/preemptible instances where safe]]
### [[Architect Cloud-native cost control tools (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Kubecost)]]
### [[Architect Chargeback/showback reporting]]
