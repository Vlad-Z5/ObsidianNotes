# Architect: Alerting rules with actionable runbooks

A strong alerting system does more than notify; it guides teams to diagnose and resolve issues quickly, reducing MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery).

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Alerting Rules
	- Define conditions or thresholds that indicate a problem.
	- Examples:
		- CPU > 90% for 5 minutes
		- Error rate > 5% on a service endpoint
		- Request latency (P95) > 500ms
- ### Actionable Alerts
	- Alerts should be actionable, avoiding noise ("pager fatigue").
	- Include context, metrics, logs, and runbook links.
- ### Runbooks
	- Step-by-step procedures for troubleshooting and remediation.
	- Include:
		- What the alert means
		- Immediate mitigation steps
		- Escalation contacts
		- Postmortem guidance
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Prometheus Alertmanager
	- Define alert rules in Prometheus YAML with severity levels and runbook annotations.
	- Alertmanager routes alerts to Slack, PagerDuty, Opsgenie, or email.
- ### Cloud-native Alerting
	- AWS CloudWatch Alarms, GCP Monitoring Alerts, Azure Monitor.
	- Link alerts to automated remediation Lambda/Cloud Function or runbooks.
- ### Service Mesh / App-level Alerts
	- Istio or Linkerd metrics (latency, error rates) feed Prometheus alerts.
	- Include trace IDs in alert context for faster RCA.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Actionable First
	- Alerts must indicate what to do next, not just that something is wrong.
- ### Severity Tiers
	- Critical, Warning, Info â€” define escalation accordingly.
- ### Runbooks Versioning
	- Keep runbooks in Git for updates and auditing.
- ### Avoid Noise
	- Deduplicate alerts; use aggregation and thresholds.
- ### Automated Remediation
	- Integrate with scripts, auto-scaling, or self-healing workflows when possible.
- ### Observability Integration
	- Include links to dashboards, logs, and traces in the alert.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Reduced MTTR
	- Guides teams to diagnose and resolve issues quickly.
- ### Context
	- Provides immediate context and next steps for responders.
- ### Consistency
	- Standardized response procedures across the organization.
- ### Learning
	- Runbooks serve as knowledge base for incident response training.
