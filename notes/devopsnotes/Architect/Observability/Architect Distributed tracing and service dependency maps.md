# Architect: Distributed tracing and service dependency maps

These tools help understand request flow, latency, and service dependencies, making root cause analysis much faster.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Distributed Tracing
	- Tracks a request end-to-end across multiple services.
	- Each service adds spans (timed segments) to the trace.
	- Provides latency, error, and bottleneck visibility.
- ### Service Dependency Maps
	- Visual representation of how services interact.
	- Identifies upstream/downstream dependencies.
	- Useful for impact analysis during outages or deployments.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### OpenTelemetry (OTel)
	- Instrument applications to generate traces automatically.
	- Supports multiple languages (Java, Go, Python, Node).
	- Collects spans, metrics, and logs in a unified format.
- ### Tracing Backends
	- Jaeger: Visualization and analysis of traces.
	- Tempo: Scalable trace storage.
	- Zipkin: Lightweight tracing solution.
- ### Service Mesh Integration
	- Istio, Linkerd, Consul can auto-inject trace headers.
	- Provides out-of-the-box service dependency maps.
- ### Visualization
	- Grafana, Jaeger UI, Kiali (for service mesh).
	- Shows trace duration, error rate per span, and traffic flow.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Trace Context Propagation
	- Ensure all services propagate trace IDs.
- ### Sampling Strategies
	- Probabilistic or rate-limited sampling to reduce overhead.
- ### Correlation with Logs
	- Include trace IDs in logs to pivot between metrics, logs, and traces.
- ### Dependency Maps for Planning
	- Use maps to plan canary deployments, understand failure impact.
- ### Alerting on Latency & Errors
	- Trigger alerts when traces show anomalies.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Root Cause Analysis
	- Faster RCA: Quickly pinpoint failing services in complex systems.
- ### Performance
	- Latency Analysis: Identify performance bottlenecks.
- ### Planning
	- Capacity Planning: Observe inter-service load and hotspots.
- ### Impact Analysis
	- Change Impact Assessment: See which services rely on new deployments.
