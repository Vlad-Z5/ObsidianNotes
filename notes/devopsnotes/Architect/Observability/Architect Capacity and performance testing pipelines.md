# Architect: Capacity and performance testing pipelines

These pipelines help teams validate system behavior under expected and extreme conditions, ensuring the infrastructure and applications meet performance SLOs.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Capacity Testing
	- Determines how much load the system can handle before performance degradation.
	- Examples: max concurrent users, message queue throughput, API requests/sec.
- ### Performance Testing
	- Measures system responsiveness and stability under various loads.
	- Types:
		- Load testing: normal expected traffic
		- Stress testing: beyond normal capacity to identify breaking points
		- Spike testing: sudden bursts of traffic
		- Endurance testing: sustained traffic over time
- ### Objectives
	- Identify bottlenecks (CPU, memory, network, database).
	- Validate autoscaling policies.
	- Ensure SLO/SLA compliance under load.
## 2. Pipeline Integration Patterns
- ### CI/CD Integration
	- Run performance unit tests during pipeline builds (lightweight).
	- Schedule full-scale tests in staging or pre-production.
- ### Infrastructure-as-Code Integration
	- Spin up ephemeral test environments using Terraform, Pulumi, or Kubernetes.
	- Use realistic service topology matching production.
- ### Tooling
	- Load Testing: JMeter, Locust, k6, Gatling
	- Profiling & Metrics: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry
	- Chaos + Performance: Combine with chaos experiments to test resilience under stress
- ### Test Data Management
	- Use representative datasets for realistic testing.
	- Avoid production data unless anonymized.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Automate Pipelines
	- Integrate with CI/CD for consistent testing and repeatability.
- ### Measure Relevant Metrics
	- Latency (P95/P99), error rates, throughput, resource utilization.
- ### Run Incremental Load
	- Gradually increase traffic to identify thresholds.
- ### Correlate with Observability
	- Link performance results to logs, metrics, and traces.
- ### Use Ephemeral Environments
	- Avoid polluting staging; tear down after testing.
- ### Capacity Planning
	- Use results to optimize scaling policies, resource allocation, and cost.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Early Detection
	- Identifies bottlenecks before production impact.
- ### Validation
	- Validates autoscaling and failover policies.
- ### Compliance
	- Supports SLO/SLA compliance by ensuring systems meet performance expectations.
- ### Optimization
	- Guides resource optimization and cost efficiency.
