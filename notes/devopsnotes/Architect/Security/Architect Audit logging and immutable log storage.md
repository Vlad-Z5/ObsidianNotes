# Architect: Audit logging and immutable log storage

Audit logging captures all significant system and user activity, while immutable storage ensures logs cannot be altered or deleted, preserving integrity.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Audit Logging
	- Records who did what, when, and where.
	- Critical for security monitoring, compliance, and troubleshooting.
	- Examples:
		- AWS CloudTrail logs API activity.
		- Kubernetes Audit Logs capture API server requests.
		- Database audit logs record queries and access attempts.
- ### Immutable Log Storage
	- Logs are write-once, read-many (WORM).
	- Prevents tampering, accidental deletion, or malicious modification.
	- Examples:
		- AWS S3 with Object Lock
		- GCP Cloud Audit Logs with retention policies
		- Append-only log databases (e.g., Elasticsearch with ILM policies)
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Cloud Audit Logging
	- AWS: CloudTrail + CloudWatch Logs → centralized logging S3 bucket with Object Lock for immutability.
	- GCP: Cloud Audit Logs → export to Cloud Storage or BigQuery with retention policies.
	- Azure: Azure Activity Logs → archive to immutable storage accounts.
- ### Kubernetes Logging
	- Enable API server audit logging.
	- Send logs to ELK/EFK stack or cloud logging service.
	- Enforce immutable retention policies and RBAC for log access.
- ### SIEM Integration
	- Forward audit logs to SIEM (Splunk, Sumo Logic, Datadog Security, QRadar).
	- Automate alerting on suspicious or anomalous activity.
- ### Immutable Storage Techniques
	- Use WORM-enabled buckets or append-only storage.
	- Enable retention policies to comply with regulatory requirements.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Centralize Logs
	- Collect logs from all services, applications, and infra in one place.
- ### Enforce Immutability
	- Protect logs from tampering using WORM or append-only policies.
- ### Structured Logging
	- Include metadata like user ID, request ID, timestamps, and resource identifiers.
- ### Monitor & Alert
	- Detect unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts.
- ### Retention Policies
	- Define retention periods based on compliance (HIPAA, PCI, SOC2).
- ### Access Controls
	- Only authorized personnel can read logs; no deletion rights.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Investigation
	- Enables forensic investigations after incidents.
- ### Compliance
	- Supports regulatory compliance audits.
- ### Security
	- Detects insider threats or misconfigurations quickly.
- ### Accountability
	- Ensures trustworthy historical records for accountability.
