# Architect: Data Encryption at Rest & In Transit

Encryption ensures that data cannot be read or tampered with, whether it is stored or moving across networks.

## 1. Core Concepts

### Encryption at Rest

Protects data stored in databases, file systems, object storage, or backups.

Prevents unauthorized access if storage media is compromised.

Examples:

AWS S3 server-side encryption (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS)

EBS volumes encrypted with KMS keys

Database encryption (MySQL TDE, PostgreSQL pgcrypto)

### Encryption in Transit

Protects data moving between services, clients, and APIs.

Prevents eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Examples:

HTTPS/TLS for web traffic

mTLS for service-to-service communication

VPN or IPsec for private network traffic

## 2. Implementation Patterns
### A. Cloud-Native Encryption

AWS:

KMS-managed keys for S3, EBS, RDS.

Enable S3 bucket policies to enforce encrypted uploads.

GCP:

Cloud KMS + CMEK for storage and compute resources.

Azure:

Azure Key Vault + storage service encryption.

### B. Kubernetes

Secrets Management: Use KMS-backed solutions (e.g., External Secrets, SealedSecrets).

Network encryption: Use mTLS via service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) for intra-cluster traffic.

### C. TLS / mTLS

Use TLS 1.2+ for all external communication.

Implement mutual TLS for secure service-to-service authentication.

### D. Key Management

Use centralized key management (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault).

Rotate keys periodically and enforce access policies.

## 3. Best Practices

### Enforce Encryption by Default

All storage and backups must be encrypted.

### Use Strong Protocols

TLS 1.2/1.3, AES-256 for data at rest.

### Centralize Key Management

Audit, rotate, and revoke keys efficiently.

### Service-to-Service Encryption

Enable mTLS inside clusters and across microservices.

### Audit & Monitoring

Track encryption configuration changes and key usage.

### Avoid Hardcoding Keys

Always fetch keys from secure vaults, never embed in code.

## 4. Operational Benefits

Protects sensitive PII, PHI, and financial data.

Ensures compliance with HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, SOC2.

Reduces risk if storage devices or network traffic are intercepted.

Supports zero-trust and secure multi-cloud architectures.
