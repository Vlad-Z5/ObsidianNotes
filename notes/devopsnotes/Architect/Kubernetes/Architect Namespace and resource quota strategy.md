# Architect: Namespace and resource quota strategy

Namespaces and resource quotas ensure logical separation, fair resource allocation, and operational stability in Kubernetes clusters, especially in multi-tenant environments.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Namespace
	- Logical partition within a cluster to isolate workloads, resources, and permissions.
- ### Resource Quota
	- Limits on CPU, memory, and object counts (pods, services, configmaps) per namespace.
- ### LimitRange
	- Sets default/min/max CPU and memory for containers within a namespace.
- ### Pod Disruption Budget (PDB)
	- Ensures minimum number of pods remain available during maintenance or scaling.
- ### Goal
	- Prevent one team or workload from consuming excessive resources, maintain isolation, and enforce governance.
## 2. Patterns & Best Practices
- ### Namespace Design
	- One namespace per team, project, or environment.
	- Use clear naming conventions: teamA-dev, teamA-prod.
	- Apply labels and annotations for cost allocation, auditing, and observability.
- ### Resource Quotas
	- Define hard limits on CPU, memory, and object counts.
	- Example configuration with requests.cpu: "4", requests.memory: 8Gi, limits.cpu: "8", limits.memory: 16Gi, pods: "10"
	- Prevents noisy neighbor issues and ensures cluster stability.
- ### LimitRange
	- Set default requests/limits for containers in the namespace.
	- Helps enforce consistency and avoid pod eviction due to overcommit.
- ### Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)
	- Ensure high availability during node replacement or cluster upgrades.
	- Example: At least 80% of replicas remain available during disruptions.
- ### Multi-Tenancy Governance
	- Combine namespace, quota, and RBAC to isolate teams.
	- Enforce admission policies (Kyverno/OPA) to require quotas on new namespaces.
## 3. Operational Benefits
- ### Resource Management
	- Prevents resource contention across teams.
	- Supports predictable performance for critical workloads.
- ### Cost Control
	- Enables cost tracking per namespace for FinOps.
- ### Scalability
	- Integrates with autoscaling (HPA/Cluster Autoscaler) for dynamic workloads without exceeding quotas.
## 4. Observability & Auditing
- ### Monitoring
	- Prometheus: Track quota usage and alerts for nearing limits.
	- Kubernetes Dashboard / Lens: Visualize namespace and resource usage.
- ### Auditing
	- Audit logs: Track creation of namespaces and resource usage violations.
