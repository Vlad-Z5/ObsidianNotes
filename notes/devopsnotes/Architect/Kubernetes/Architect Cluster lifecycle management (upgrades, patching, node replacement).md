# Cluster Lifecycle Management (Upgrades, Patching, Node Replacement)

Cluster lifecycle management focuses on planning, upgrading, patching, and maintaining Kubernetes clusters to ensure stability, security, and minimal downtime.

## 1. Core Concepts

### Cluster Lifecycle Stages:

**Provisioning:** Initial cluster setup, node pools, networking, and RBAC.

**Ongoing Maintenance:** Patching, upgrades, scaling nodes, monitoring health.

**Decommissioning:** Safely retiring clusters or nodes without impacting workloads.

### Key Goals:

- High availability during upgrades/patching
- Security compliance via regular patching
- Minimal downtime for production workloads
- Smooth scaling or node replacement

## 2. Upgrade Patterns

### A. Control Plane / Master Nodes

**Managed Services (EKS, GKE, AKS):**

Control plane upgrades handled by provider; architect schedules maintenance windows.

**Self-Managed Clusters:**

Upgrade kube-apiserver, etcd, controller-manager, scheduler sequentially.

**Best Practices:**

Test upgrades in staging first.

Use blue-green control plane if possible.

Ensure backup of etcd before upgrade.

### B. Worker Nodes

**Upgrade via rolling replacement:**

Drain nodes: kubectl drain <node> to evict pods safely.

Replace with new version or patched node.

Validate workloads are healthy before proceeding.

Leverage node pools for version separation.

## 3. Patching & Security Updates

### OS & Kubernetes Patches

Apply security patches for OS images regularly.

Pre-bake patched nodes as golden AMIs or container images.

### Zero-Downtime Strategy

Use rolling updates to replace nodes without affecting running pods.

### Automation

AWS Image Builder, Ansible, or automated CI/CD pipelines for patching.

Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler can help introduce patched nodes dynamically.

## 4. Node Replacement / Autoscaling Integration

### Node Replacement

Evict pods gracefully, replace with updated node.

Ensure pod disruption budgets (PDB) prevent service downtime.

### Autoscaling Integration

Cluster Autoscaler adds new nodes when capacity is insufficient.

Combine node replacement with HPA/VPA to maintain workloads.

## 5. Observability & Validation

Monitor cluster health: API server, etcd, nodes, pod health.

### Validate workloads post-upgrade using:

- Readiness/liveness probes
- CI/CD smoke tests
- Automated chaos tests in staging

Alert on anomalies during maintenance.

## 6. Tools & Automation

**Managed Kubernetes:** EKS, GKE, AKS with provider upgrades.

**Provisioning & Upgrades:** Terraform, eksctl, kops, Ansible, Packer for golden nodes.

**Node Replacement:** Cluster Autoscaler, Karpenter, Rolling Updates.

**Observability:** Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/Loki, CloudWatch/Stackdriver.
