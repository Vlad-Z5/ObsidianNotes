# Architect: Multi-tenant cluster architecture & workload isolation (RBAC, quotas, node pools)

In large organizations, multiple teams or projects often share a single Kubernetes cluster. Proper multi-tenancy ensures isolation, security, resource management, and operational efficiency.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Multi-Tenancy Types
	- Namespace-based tenancy: Each team/project gets its own namespace.
	- Node-based tenancy: Dedicated node pools per team/project.
	- Cluster-based tenancy: Separate clusters per team/project (strongest isolation, higher cost).
- ### Key Components
	- Workload Isolation: Prevents "noisy neighbors" from impacting other workloads.
	- Resource Quotas & Limits: Control CPU/memory per namespace/pod to avoid resource starvation.
	- RBAC: Role-Based Access Control restricts what users/pods can do in their namespaces.
	- Security Policies: Pod Security Standards, Network Policies, and admission controls enforce secure configurations.
- ### Value Proposition
	- Multi-tenancy enables cost-efficient resource sharing while maintaining security and reliability.
## 2. Patterns & Best Practices
- ### Namespace Isolation
	- Assign one namespace per team/project.
	- Use ResourceQuota and LimitRange to cap CPU, memory, and object counts.
	- RBAC: restrict users to their own namespaces; prevent cross-namespace access.
- ### Node Pools & Taints/Tolerations
	- Dedicated node pools for teams with high workloads or sensitive workloads.
	- Use taints and tolerations to control which pods schedule on which nodes.
	- Example: taint=teamA:NoSchedule, pods from teamA tolerate it; others cannot schedule.
- ### Network Segmentation
	- Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict pod-to-pod communication across namespaces.
	- Service Mesh (Istio/App Mesh) can enforce mTLS and fine-grained traffic control.
- ### Resource Governance
	- CPU/memory requests and limits per pod ensure fair scheduling.
	- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler ensures pods scale within namespace limits.
	- Quotas prevent one team from consuming all cluster resources.
- ### Security Enforcement
	- Admission controllers (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno) validate pod specs before deployment.
	- Pod Security Standards enforce safe security contexts, non-root users, and capabilities.
	- Secret management: each namespace uses Vault or Kubernetes secrets with RBAC restrictions.
- ### Observability & Multi-Tenant Monitoring
	- Prometheus multi-tenant setup with separate scrape configs per namespace.
	- Centralized logging but filter sensitive data by namespace.
	- Alerting rules scoped per tenant to avoid alert fatigue.
## 3. Tools & Automation
- ### Access Control
	- RBAC: Kubernetes native RBAC.
- ### Resource Management
	- Resource Quotas & LimitRanges: Native Kubernetes objects.
- ### Policy Enforcement
	- Admission Controllers: OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno.
- ### Network Security
	- Network Isolation: Calico, Cilium, Istio/App Mesh.
- ### Observability
	- Monitoring: Prometheus + Thanos or Cortex for multi-tenant metrics; FluentBit/Fluentd for logs.
- ### Deployment
	- CI/CD: ArgoCD, FluxCD, Tekton, GitOps flows per team.
