# Multi-Tenant Cluster Architecture & Workload Isolation

In large organizations, multiple teams or projects often share a single Kubernetes cluster. Proper multi-tenancy ensures isolation, security, resource management, and operational efficiency.

## 1. Core Concepts

### Multi-Tenancy Types:

**Namespace-based tenancy:** Each team/project gets its own namespace.

**Node-based tenancy:** Dedicated node pools per team/project.

**Cluster-based tenancy:** Separate clusters per team/project (strongest isolation, higher cost).

**Workload Isolation:** Prevents "noisy neighbors" from impacting other workloads.

**Resource Quotas & Limits:** Control CPU/memory per namespace/pod to avoid resource starvation.

**RBAC:** Role-Based Access Control restricts what users/pods can do in their namespaces.

**Security Policies:** Pod Security Standards, Network Policies, and admission controls enforce secure configurations.

**Why it matters:** Multi-tenancy enables cost-efficient resource sharing while maintaining security and reliability.

## 2. Patterns & Best Practices

### A. Namespace Isolation

Assign one namespace per team/project.

Use ResourceQuota and LimitRange to cap CPU, memory, and object counts.

RBAC: restrict users to their own namespaces; prevent cross-namespace access.

### B. Node Pools & Taints/Tolerations

Dedicated node pools for teams with high workloads or sensitive workloads.

Use taints and tolerations to control which pods schedule on which nodes.

Example: taint=teamA:NoSchedule, pods from teamA tolerate it; others cannot schedule.

### C. Network Segmentation

Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to restrict pod-to-pod communication across namespaces.

Service Mesh (Istio/App Mesh) can enforce mTLS and fine-grained traffic control.

### D. Resource Governance

CPU/memory requests and limits per pod ensure fair scheduling.

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler ensures pods scale within namespace limits.

Quotas prevent one team from consuming all cluster resources.

### E. Security Enforcement

Admission controllers (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno) validate pod specs before deployment.

Pod Security Standards enforce safe security contexts, non-root users, and capabilities.

Secret management: each namespace uses Vault or Kubernetes secrets with RBAC restrictions.

### F. Observability & Multi-Tenant Monitoring

Prometheus multi-tenant setup with separate scrape configs per namespace.

Centralized logging but filter sensitive data by namespace.

Alerting rules scoped per tenant to avoid alert fatigue.

## 3. Tools & Automation

**RBAC:** Kubernetes native RBAC.

**Resource Quotas & LimitRanges:** Native Kubernetes objects.

**Admission Controllers:** OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno.

**Network Isolation:** Calico, Cilium, Istio/App Mesh.

**Monitoring:** Prometheus + Thanos or Cortex for multi-tenant metrics; FluentBit/Fluentd for logs.

**CI/CD:** ArgoCD, FluxCD, Tekton, GitOps flows per team.
