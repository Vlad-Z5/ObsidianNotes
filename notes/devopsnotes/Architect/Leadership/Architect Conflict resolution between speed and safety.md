# Architect: Conflict resolution between speed and safety

DevOps teams often face tension between rapid feature delivery (speed) and operational reliability, security, and compliance (safety). Effective resolution ensures business objectives are met without compromising service integrity.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Speed
	- Delivering features, updates, and fixes quickly to meet market or user demands.
- ### Safety
	- Maintaining system reliability, security, compliance, and operational standards.
- ### Tradeoff
	- Faster deployments can increase risk of outages, incidents, or non-compliance.
	- Slower, overly cautious processes can reduce innovation and user satisfaction.
- ### Key Objectives
	- Balance risk and velocity through data-driven decisions, automation, and policy enforcement.
	- Communicate tradeoffs clearly to technical teams and leadership.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Error Budgets
	- Use error budgets to quantify acceptable risk for SLOs.
	- Teams can push speed until the error budget is consumed, balancing risk and delivery.
- ### Automated Safety Gates
	- Implement CI/CD checks, automated tests, and security scans to prevent unsafe deployments.
	- Examples:
		- Unit, integration, and regression tests
		- Vulnerability scanning and linting
		- Policy-as-code (OPA/Gatekeeper) enforcement
- ### Phased Rollouts
	- Use canary, blue-green, or feature-flag deployments to limit blast radius.
	- Allows rapid feedback while reducing impact of potential failures.
- ### Cross-Team Alignment
	- Align product, engineering, and operations on acceptable risk levels.
	- Conduct risk assessment meetings for high-impact releases.
- ### Transparent Communication
	- Share tradeoffs, risks, and potential impact with leadership.
	- Document decisions and rationale to maintain accountability and learning.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define Risk Appetite
	- Clearly communicate what level of downtime, errors, or compliance deviation is acceptable.
- ### Automate Safety Checks
	- Reduce human bottlenecks and prevent unsafe actions.
- ### Iterative Delivery
	- Break large changes into smaller, safer increments.
- ### Post-Incident Analysis
	- Learn from incidents to improve policies, tests, and deployment strategies.
- ### Culture of Trust
	- Encourage teams to move fast but responsibly, promoting accountability.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Reliability
	- Maintains high reliability without sacrificing speed.
- ### Risk Reduction
	- Reduces incidents caused by rushed deployments.
- ### Autonomy
	- Improves developer autonomy and confidence.
- ### Business Agility
	- Supports business agility while maintaining compliance and safety.
