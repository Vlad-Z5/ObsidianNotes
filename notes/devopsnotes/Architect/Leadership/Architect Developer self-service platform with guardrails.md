# Architect: Developer self-service platform with guardrails

A self-service platform allows developers to provision, deploy, and manage resources without waiting for centralized operations, while guardrails ensure safety, compliance, and cost control.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Self-Service
	- Developers can create environments, deploy applications, and manage infrastructure independently.
	- Reduces bottlenecks and improves velocity.
- ### Guardrails
	- Automated policies and constraints that prevent unsafe or non-compliant actions.
	- Ensure security, reliability, and cost control without blocking developer autonomy.
- ### Key Objectives
	- Enable rapid experimentation and feature delivery.
	- Maintain governance and compliance.
	- Reduce human errors and misconfigurations.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Infrastructure as a Service Layer
	- Provide self-service IaC templates (Terraform, Pulumi, Crossplane).
	- Example: Developers provision EKS clusters, databases, or VMs through predefined modules.
- ### Policy Enforcement / Guardrails
	- Use OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno for Kubernetes admission control.
	- Enforce constraints like:
		- Allowed instance types or regions
		- Tagging and cost center requirements
		- Security group and firewall rules
	- Implement CI/CD pipeline checks for policy compliance.
- ### Platform Tooling
	- Developer-facing portals or CLI tools:
		- Internal developer portal for environment provisioning.
		- GitOps workflows with pre-approved templates.
		- Self-service dashboards to view cost, resource usage, and environment health.
- ### Observability & Feedback
	- Automatically log provisioning actions for auditing.
	- Monitor compliance violations and provide developer feedback in real-time.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Template Reuse
	- Standardize infrastructure modules to avoid drift and duplication.
- ### Policy-as-Code
	- Encode guardrails in machine-readable policies, enforced automatically.
- ### Minimal Footguns
	- Prevent destructive actions (e.g., deleting prod resources) without restricting development agility.
- ### Cost Visibility
	- Include budget limits or alerts per environment/project.
- ### Continuous Improvement
	- Collect feedback from developers and iterate on platform capabilities.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Velocity
	- Accelerates feature delivery and reduces dependency on central ops.
- ### Governance
	- Ensures compliance and security without slowing innovation.
- ### Reliability
	- Reduces human error in infrastructure provisioning.
- ### Transparency
	- Provides auditable and traceable operations for leadership and finance.
