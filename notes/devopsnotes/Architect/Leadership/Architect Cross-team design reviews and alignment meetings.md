# Architect: Cross-team design reviews and alignment meetings

Cross-team design reviews ensure that architectural decisions, system changes, and platform initiatives are consistent, secure, and aligned with business goals across teams.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Purpose
	- Reduce siloed decision-making and misalignment.
	- Share knowledge of system dependencies, tradeoffs, and risks.
	- Promote best practices and standards adoption.
- ### Scope
	- Architecture proposals
	- CI/CD pipeline changes
	- Cloud and hybrid infrastructure patterns
	- Security and compliance initiatives
	- Major feature or service changes
- ### Key Objectives
	- Ensure scalability, reliability, and security across teams.
	- Identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps before implementation.
	- Build shared understanding and consensus.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Structured Design Review Process
	- Submit design documents in advance.
	- Include:
		- Architectural diagrams
		- Dependencies and interfaces
		- Tradeoffs and alternatives considered
		- Impact on SLOs, cost, and operational complexity
	- Schedule reviews with cross-functional representation (DevOps, SRE, security, product).
- ### Alignment Meetings
	- Regular syncs for platform decisions, standards, and upcoming initiatives.
	- Discuss:
		- Service-level dependencies
		- Changes to shared infrastructure or libraries
		- Security and compliance updates
		- CI/CD and IaC best practices
- ### Collaborative Tools
	- Use Confluence, Miro, GitHub PRs, or Slack threads to document decisions.
	- Maintain versioned design docs and action items.
- ### Feedback and Action Tracking
	- Capture review feedback with decisions and rationale.
	- Assign owners for follow-ups and track completion.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Prepare and Circulate Docs
	- Ensure attendees have time to review before meetings.
- ### Blameless Culture
	- Focus discussions on systems and processes, not individuals.
- ### Consensus with Clear Decisions
	- Document agreements, tradeoffs, and responsibilities.
- ### Regular Cadence
	- Weekly or bi-weekly sessions for ongoing alignment.
- ### Post-Review Follow-Up
	- Ensure action items are tracked, implemented, and verified.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Coordination
	- Prevents duplicate work or conflicting changes across teams.
- ### Quality
	- Improves system reliability, scalability, and security.
- ### Knowledge Sharing
	- Fosters knowledge sharing and cross-team collaboration.
- ### Culture
	- Builds a culture of accountability and transparency in architectural decisions.
