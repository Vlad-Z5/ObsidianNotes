Use separate AWS accounts or separate clusters for prod critical workloads; if single cluster, use strict tenancy model:

AWS IAM + OIDC + IRSA for least privilege.

Namespaces per team/env + NetworkPolicies (deny by default).

ResourceQuota + LimitRange to cap CPU/memory and ephemeral storage.

Node pools (managed nodegroups or managed node groups / fargate profiles) by tenant/workload class → isolate noisy workloads onto dedicated node groups.

PodDisruptionBudgets for critical workloads; taints/tolerations to keep noisy jobs off prod nodes.

Use KSM (Kubernetes metrics) + Vertical/Horizontal Pod Autoscalers with sensible thresholds.

Dedicated logging/monitoring namespaces with resource limits and sampling for noisy logs.
What they’re testing: tradeoffs between security vs. cost vs. isolation; multi-account vs multi-namespace; runtime isolation techniques.
Good follow-ups to ask: expected scale (# clusters, pods), compliance requirements, CI/CD model, cost sensitivity.
Checklist bullets: RBAC least privilege, network policy deny-all, quotas, taints/tolerations, separate node pools, observability & quotas on logging/metrics.

Q: What’s your approach to managing 10+ Kustomize overlays without drift or duplication?

Model answer:

Adopt a base + overlay pattern: one canonical base per app, overlays per environment.

Don’t duplicate resources — use Kustomize patches/vars and generators.

Keep environment config minimal (only environment-specific values).

Use templating for secrets/configMaps via sealed-secrets/External Secrets; store overlays in Git as branches or directories with clear naming convention.

Validate overlays in CI: kustomize build + kubectl apply --server-dry-run=client + schema validation (kubeval/custom schema).

Periodic automated drift detection: generate manifests from each overlay and compare to canonical base or golden images.
What they’re testing: reproducibility, GitOps hygiene, drift detection.
Keywords to use: base/overlay, kustomize patchesStrategicPatch, sealed-secrets, CI validation, schema validation, GitOps.

Q: Explain how you’d secure cross-region S3 replication and validate data integrity at scale.

Model answer:

Secure replication:

Use S3 Replication (CRR/Cross-Region Replication) with AWS KMS — use separate CMKs in source/dest and grant replication role permissions.

Enforce bucket policies & VPC endpoints, block public access.

Use IAM replication role restricted to necessary actions.

Use S3 Object Lock (if immutability required).

Checklist: backup & restore tested, migration backwards-compatibility, incremental partitioned upgrade, health checks & probes, canary.

Q: Describe a hybrid cloud routing architecture between GCP and AWS. Where do you enforce boundaries?

Model answer:

Routing architecture:

Use VPC/VPC-peer or Transit Gateway on AWS, Cloud Router + VPN/Interconnect on GCP. Connect via an encrypted transit (VPN/MPLS/direct connect via partner).

Use Transit Gateway / Shared VPC hubs and enforce egress/ingress via firewall appliances (NGFW) or cloud-native routes with next-hop appliances.

Use service mesh or API gateway for cross-cloud service calls; prefer egress through centralized gateways to enforce policies and observe traffic.

Boundaries enforcement:

Identity/auth: central identity (Okta) + federated IAM; enforce at service layer and API gateway.

Data boundaries: encryption, DLP, region residency — enforce at storage & gateway layer.

Network boundaries: restrict routes, central firewall, NAT, and egress filtering.
What they’re testing: networking fundamentals & operational boundaries.

Q: Your Terraform state got corrupted during a backend migration. Rebuild strategy?

Model answer:

Immediately: snapshot/back up the corrupt state file (do not overwrite).

Try recover:

Use terraform state pull to get current, or check backend provider (S3 versioning) for prior object versions.

Use terraform state rm to remove problematic resources, then terraform import to rebuild resource mapping, or reconstruct state manually with terraform state commands.

If unrecoverable:

Recreate clean state by importing each resource (scripted with SDKs) — prioritize critical infra first.

Add automated tests and enable state locking and backend versioning after recovery.
Checklist: backend object versioning, state locking, automated backups, import scripts, test in staging.

Q: Bash one-liner: Find all running containers using more than 500MB RSS memory on a node.

Answer:

ps aux --sort=-rss | awk '$6>500*1024 {print $0}'

8. Observability & Monitoring (Metrics, Logging, Tracing, SLOs, Distributed Debugging)

A DevOps Architect must design observability as a first-class citizen in infra & app platforms.
It’s not just about “collecting logs” — it’s about ensuring visibility, correlation, and actionable insights across cloud + on-prem.
