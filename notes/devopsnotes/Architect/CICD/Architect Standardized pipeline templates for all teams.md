# Architect: Standardized pipeline templates for all teams

A DevOps Architect ensures pipelines aren't hand-crafted per team but are standardized, reusable, and governed, while still allowing team-specific overrides.

## 1. Why Standardization Matters
- ### Consistency
	- Same build → test → deploy flow across all services.
- ### Security
	- Enforce secrets management, scanning, approvals by default.
- ### Compliance
	- Centralized logging/auditing of builds and deployments.
- ### Efficiency
	- Developers focus on code, not pipeline boilerplate.
- ### Governance
	- Avoids drift between pipelines over time.
## 2. Core Design Principles
- ### Pipeline-as-Code
	- Store pipelines in Git (Jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml, GitHub Actions, Tekton).
- ### Template Libraries
	- Centralized templates or modules (Terraform-like approach for CI/CD).
- ### Parameterization
	- Allow overrides for environment-specific needs (dev, QA, prod).
- ### Security by Default
	- Built-in checks (linting, SAST/DAST, SBOM generation).
- ### Extensibility
	- Teams can extend templates with custom stages.
- ### Compliance Hooks
	- Mandatory approval gates for prod deployments.
## 3. Tooling Patterns
- ### Jenkins Shared Libraries
	- Versioned Groovy libraries for reusable stages.
- ### GitLab CI Templates
	- .gitlab-ci.yml includes from a central repo.
- ### GitHub Actions Reusable Workflows
	- Define once, consume across repos.
- ### Tekton Pipelines + Catalogs
	- Kubernetes-native, modular pipeline steps.
- ### Spinnaker / ArgoCD Integration
	- For GitOps-style deployment flows.
## 4. Example Pipeline Template (Conceptual)
- ### Basic Structure
	- stages: lint, test, security, build, deploy
	- Teams would extend or override pieces while reusing 80–90% of the template.
## 5. Governance & Control
- ### Central Repository
	- Central CI/CD repo with version-controlled templates.
- ### Mandatory Checks
	- Code quality, security scans, SBOM.
- ### Environment Separation
	- Dev/QA automated, Prod gated with approvals.
- ### Audit Trail
	- Every deployment linked to Git commit + CI job ID.
## 6. Best Practices
- ### Documentation
	- Provide onboarding docs & examples for teams.
- ### Testing
	- Test templates in sandbox repos before rollout org-wide.
- ### Observability
	- Build observability into pipelines (timing, failures, test coverage).
- ### Policy Validation
	- Use policy engines (OPA/Conftest) to validate pipelines themselves.
- ### Multi-Cloud Support
	- Support multi-cloud runners (AWS, GCP, on-prem) for flexibility.
