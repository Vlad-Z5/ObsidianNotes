# Standardized Pipeline Templates for All Teams

A DevOps Architect ensures pipelines aren't hand-crafted per team but are standardized, reusable, and governed, while still allowing team-specific overrides.

## 1. Why Standardization Matters

**Consistency:** Same build → test → deploy flow across all services.

**Security:** Enforce secrets management, scanning, approvals by default.

**Compliance:** Centralized logging/auditing of builds and deployments.

**Efficiency:** Developers focus on code, not pipeline boilerplate.

**Governance:** Avoids drift between pipelines over time.

## 2. Core Design Principles

**Pipeline-as-Code:** Store pipelines in Git (Jenkinsfile, .gitlab-ci.yml, GitHub Actions, Tekton).

**Template Libraries:** Centralized templates or modules (Terraform-like approach for CI/CD).

**Parameterization:** Allow overrides for environment-specific needs (dev, QA, prod).

**Security by Default:** Built-in checks (linting, SAST/DAST, SBOM generation).

**Extensibility:** Teams can extend templates with custom stages.

**Compliance Hooks:** Mandatory approval gates for prod deployments.

## 3. Tooling Patterns

**Jenkins Shared Libraries:** Versioned Groovy libraries for reusable stages.

**GitLab CI Templates:** .gitlab-ci.yml includes from a central repo.

**GitHub Actions Reusable Workflows:** Define once, consume across repos.

**Tekton Pipelines + Catalogs:** Kubernetes-native, modular pipeline steps.

**Spinnaker / ArgoCD Integration:** For GitOps-style deployment flows.

## 4. Example Pipeline Template (Conceptual)

```yaml
stages:
  - lint
  - test
  - security
  - build
  - deploy

lint:
  script: run-linter.sh

test:
  script: run-tests.sh

security:
  script: run-sast.sh

build:
  script: docker build -t $IMAGE:$VERSION .

deploy:
  when: manual
  script: helm upgrade --install myapp ./charts/myapp
```

Teams would extend or override pieces while reusing 80–90% of the template.

## 5. Governance & Control

Central CI/CD repo with version-controlled templates.

Mandatory checks: code quality, security scans, SBOM.

Environment separation: Dev/QA automated, Prod gated with approvals.

Audit trail: Every deployment linked to Git commit + CI job ID.

## 6. Best Practices

Provide onboarding docs & examples for teams.

Test templates in sandbox repos before rollout org-wide.

Build observability into pipelines (timing, failures, test coverage).

Use policy engines (OPA/Conftest) to validate pipelines themselves.

Support multi-cloud runners (AWS, GCP, on-prem) for flexibility.
