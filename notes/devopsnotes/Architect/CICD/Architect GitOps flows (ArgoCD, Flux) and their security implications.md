# DevOps Architect Readiness Checklist: GitOps Flows (ArgoCD, Flux) and Security Implications

GitOps is the practice of using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. Tools like ArgoCD and Flux continuously reconcile what's running in Kubernetes against what's declared in Git.

## 1. Core GitOps Flow

**Declarative Config in Git**

Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, or Kustomize overlays stored in a repo.

**Continuous Reconciliation**

ArgoCD or Flux pulls desired state from Git.

Compares with the actual state in the cluster.

Automatically applies changes or raises drift alerts.

**Auditability**

All changes flow through Git commits, reviews, and merges.

Git history = audit trail of infra/app lifecycle.

## 2. GitOps Tooling

**ArgoCD**

Pull-based reconciliation (controller runs in cluster).

GUI + CLI for visibility and rollbacks.

Supports Helm, Kustomize, plain YAML.

RBAC + SSO integration for multi-tenant clusters.

**Flux**

Also pull-based, operator-driven.

Strong GitOps primitives for multi-repo workflows.

Deep integration with Helm and Kustomize.

CLI-driven, lightweight compared to ArgoCD.

## 3. Security Implications

**A. Git Repository Security**

Git repo becomes the critical trust anchor.

Must enforce:

Branch protection + PR reviews.

Signed commits and tags.

Secret scanning in repos (no plaintext secrets).

**B. Secrets Management**

Never store secrets in Git.

Use External Secrets Operator, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or SOPS+KMS.

ArgoCD Vault Plugin or External Secrets syncers integrate secrets securely.

**C. Access Control**

ArgoCD/Flux should have least-privilege RBAC in the cluster.

Multi-tenant setups require RBAC per project/namespace.

Avoid giving GitOps controllers cluster-admin in production.

**D. Drift Detection & Policy Enforcement**

GitOps ensures drift is auto-reconciled, but:

Malicious/manual changes in cluster are overwritten.

Policies (OPA/Gatekeeper, Kyverno) enforce compliance before apply.

**E. Supply Chain Security**

Ensure manifests reference signed, trusted container images.

Integrate cosign / sigstore for image signature verification.

SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) stored alongside manifests.

## 4. Operational Benefits

Auditability: Every change is tracked in Git.

Stability: Auto-healing ensures drift corrections.

Rollback: Git revert = instant rollback.

Compliance: Easier evidence for audits (SOC2, HIPAA, PCI).

## 5. Best Practices

Enforce code review on GitOps repos.

Use branching strategy (dev → stage → prod) for environments.

Keep infra and app repos separate if scaling across teams.

Integrate policy-as-code checks in PRs before merge.

Rotate GitOps controller tokens/credentials regularly.

Monitor GitOps tools themselves (Prometheus metrics, audit logs).

# Content from previous subtopic: [[Standardized pipeline templates for all teams

Standardized pipelines with security scans, test automation, canary/blue-green deployments.

GitOps patterns (Argo CD, Flux).

Secrets management integration (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, External Secrets).

Observability

Centralized logging, metrics, tracing (ELK/EFK, Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry).

SLO/SLI/SLA definitions & enforcement.

Alerting architecture & runbook automation.

Security & Compliance

Secure software supply chain (artifact signing, SBOM, provenance).

Shift-left security in pipelines (SAST, DAST, container scanning).

Network segmentation, least-privilege IAM, runtime security (Falco, Aqua, Wiz).

Compliance automation (CIS benchmarks, SOC2, HIPAA, ISO27001, PCI-DSS as applicable).

3. Operational Excellence

Incident Management: Postmortems, RCA frameworks, automated recovery patterns.

Change Management: Controlled rollouts, approvals, feature flagging.

Configuration Management: Standard OS builds, agent baselines, patching strategy.

Performance Engineering: Load testing, capacity validation, performance regression detection.

4. Leadership & Influence

Mentorship: Guide engineers in infrastructure patterns, CI/CD best practices, and cloud-native development.

Cross-team Facilitation: Align platform features with application team needs.

Executive Communication: Translate technical metrics into business outcomes.

Vendor/Tool Evaluation: Run POCs, negotiate contracts, ensure ROI.

5. Key Deliverables

Cloud landing zone architecture diagrams.

IaC module library with documentation and examples.
