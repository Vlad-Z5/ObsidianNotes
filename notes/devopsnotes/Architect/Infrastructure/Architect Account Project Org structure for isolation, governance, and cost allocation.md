# Architect: Account Project Org structure for isolation, governance, and cost allocation

This is crucial in AWS + multi-cloud environments because improper structuring leads to security risks, billing chaos, and operational headaches. Let's deep dive.

## 1. Core Principles
- ### Isolation by environment / business unit / workload
	- Separate production from non-prod (dev, QA, staging) to prevent accidental access.
	- Segregate sensitive workloads (PCI, HIPAA, or internal critical apps).
- ### Least privilege & centralized governance
	- Organize accounts/projects so policies can be applied consistently.
	- Enforce Service Control Policies (SCPs) and identity federation.
- ### Cost visibility & allocation
	- Use tagging, consolidated billing, or linked accounts to track spend by team/project.
	- Prevent cross-charging confusion for internal teams.
- ### Scalability
	- Structure should accommodate adding new teams, regions, and projects without redesign.
## 2. AWS Account Strategies
- ### Multi-Account via AWS Organizations
	- **Structure Options**
		- **Environment-Based**: Root Org → Prod Account, Staging Account, Dev/QA Account
		- **Team/Business Unit Based**: Root Org → Marketing Account, Engineering Account, Analytics Account
		- **Hybrid**: Root Org → Prod Accounts (per BU), Non-Prod Accounts (shared by multiple BUs)
	- **Benefits**
		- Strong isolation (resource, billing, IAM boundaries)
		- Enables SCP enforcement
		- Simplifies compliance audits
	- **Best Practice**
		- Enforce separate prod accounts, never share with non-prod.
		- Use AWS Control Tower or Landing Zone to automate baseline setup.
- ### Single Account with Multiple Projects
	- **When to use**
		- Small orgs, low number of teams.
		- Simpler billing, fewer accounts to manage.
	- **Drawbacks**
		- Harder to enforce environment isolation.
		- IAM policies become complex and brittle.
		- Risk of accidental access to prod from dev.
## 3. GCP / Azure Analogy
- ### GCP Projects
	- Similar to AWS accounts, but billing and IAM can be at Org or Folder level.
	- Recommended: one project per environment or workload.
- ### Azure Subscriptions
	- Acts like AWS account.
	- Resource Groups inside subscriptions for resource segregation.
- ### Hybrid Consistency
	- Keep one logical pattern across clouds to reduce mental mapping mistakes.
## 4. Governance Mechanisms
- ### AWS Service Control Policies (SCP)
	- Restrict which services or actions are allowed per account.
	- Example: Deny creation of public S3 buckets in prod accounts.
- ### IAM Identity Federation
	- SSO via SAML/OIDC (Okta, Azure AD) → reduces need to manage individual AWS users.
- ### Tagging & Resource Organization
	- Tags: env=prod, team=analytics, cost-center=1234
	- Mandatory tagging enforced via policies.
	- Use for cost allocation, automation, and compliance.
- ### Landing Zone / Baseline
	- Pre-created network, logging, monitoring, and security guardrails.
	- Automates account setup with best practices baked in.
## 5. Cost Allocation & Reporting
- ### AWS Organizations + Consolidated Billing
	- Single payer account; child accounts report usage.
- ### Cost Explorer / Budgets
	- Track by tags, account, region.
- ### Guardrails
	- Alert if spend exceeds thresholds per environment or BU.
- ### Chargeback / Showback
	- Optionally, show teams their own usage to drive efficiency.
## 6. Operational Best Practices
- ### Automation
	- Automate new account creation with Control Tower or Landing Zone.
- ### Isolation
	- Maintain separate VPCs per account to enforce isolation.
- ### Access Control
	- Use cross-account IAM roles for controlled access.
- ### Monitoring
	- Enforce mandatory logging (CloudTrail, Config, GuardDuty) in all accounts.
- ### Standardization
	- Standardize naming and tagging across all accounts/projects.
- ### Auditing
	- Periodically audit accounts for unused resources, open permissions, or drift from policies.
