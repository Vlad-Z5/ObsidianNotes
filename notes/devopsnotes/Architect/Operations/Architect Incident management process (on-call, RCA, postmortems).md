# Architect: Incident management process (on-call, RCA, postmortems)

Incident management ensures rapid detection, containment, and resolution of production issues, while learning from failures to prevent recurrence.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Incident Lifecycle
	- Detection: Monitoring systems or alerts identify an issue.
	- Response: On-call engineers acknowledge and begin mitigation.
	- Resolution: Restore service functionality.
	- Postmortem: Analyze root cause and prevent recurrence.
- ### Key Objectives
	- Minimize Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Recover (MTTR).
	- Maintain SLOs/SLA compliance.
	- Promote organizational learning from incidents.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### A. On-Call Management
	- Use tools like PagerDuty, Opsgenie, VictorOps to manage rotations and alerts.
	- Escalation policies ensure critical incidents reach senior engineers quickly.
- ### B. Incident Response
	- Define playbooks/runbooks for common issues (e.g., pod OOM, DB failover).
	- Use chatops (Slack, MS Teams) for coordination and documentation in real-time.
- ### C. Root Cause Analysis (RCA)
	- Determine why the incident happened, not just what failed.
	- Methods:
	- 5 Whys
	- Fishbone/Ishikawa diagrams
	- Timeline reconstruction using logs, traces, and metrics
- ### D. Postmortems
	- Document the incident with:
	- Impact summary (downtime, affected users)
	- Root cause
	- Resolution steps
	- Action items to prevent recurrence
	- Share findings across teams; encourage blameless culture.
- ### E. Continuous Improvement
	- Track action item completion.
	- Update runbooks, alerting thresholds, and automation.
	- Conduct fire drills or chaos experiments to validate learnings.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Blameless Culture
	- Focus on system/process failures, not individuals.
- ### Automated Detection
	- Alerts should be proactive and reliable to reduce MTTD.
- ### Structured Communication
	- Use dedicated incident channels, and document in real-time.
- ### Metrics-Driven
	- Measure MTTR, MTTD, incident frequency, and postmortem completion.
- ### Integrate Learnings
	- Feed RCAs into CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure improvements, and chaos engineering plans.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Service Impact
	- Reduces downtime and service impact.
- ### Team Readiness
	- Improves team readiness and collaboration under pressure.
- ### Knowledge Management
	- Provides historical knowledge for faster future response.
- ### Continuous Improvement
	- Supports continuous improvement and reliability goals.
