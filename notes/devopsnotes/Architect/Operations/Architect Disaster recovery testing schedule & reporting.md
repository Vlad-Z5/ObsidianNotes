# Architect: Disaster recovery testing schedule & reporting

Disaster recovery testing ensures that systems, applications, and data can be restored reliably in the event of a failure, outage, or disaster.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Disaster Recovery Objectives
	- RPO (Recovery Point Objective): Maximum tolerable data loss.
	- RTO (Recovery Time Objective): Maximum tolerable downtime.
	- Ensures services can resume within acceptable limits after an incident.
- ### DR Testing Goals
	- Validate that backup, failover, and recovery processes work as expected.
	- Identify gaps in documentation, processes, or infrastructure.
	- Provide audit-ready evidence for compliance.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Testing Frequency
	- Quarterly or semi-annual DR drills for critical systems.
	- Monthly spot-checks for less critical services.
	- Simulate full and partial outages across regions or clusters.
- ### Types of DR Tests
	- **Backup Restore Validation**
		- Restore databases, object storage, and VMs to staging environments.
	- **Failover Testing**
		- Switch traffic to secondary regions, clusters, or data centers.
	- **Chaos Engineering for DR**
		- Simulate infrastructure failures to validate auto-scaling and failover mechanisms.
	- **Application-Level DR**
		- Test stateful workloads and dependent services for proper recovery.
- ### Reporting
	- Document:
		- Test scenario and scope
		- Steps executed
		- Time to recover (RTO)
		- Data loss (RPO)
		- Issues and remediation items
	- Share results with leadership and auditors.
	- Maintain a DR test history to track improvements over time.
- ### Automation & Orchestration
	- Use Terraform, Ansible, Velero, or cloud-native DR tools to automate recovery steps.
	- Integrate with monitoring and alerting for real-time observation during tests.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define Clear DR Metrics
	- RPO and RTO per service and critical component.
- ### Test in Production-Like Environments
	- Ensure DR scenarios reflect realistic workloads and dependencies.
- ### Automate Recovery Where Possible
	- Reduce human error and increase reliability of DR processes.
- ### Post-Test Review
	- Document lessons learned, update runbooks, and fix gaps.
- ### Compliance Alignment
	- Ensure DR testing meets regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI, SOC2).
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Confidence
	- Provides confidence that services can recover from outages.
- ### Business Continuity
	- Reduces unplanned downtime and business impact.
- ### Compliance
	- Ensures regulatory and internal compliance.
- ### Readiness
	- Improves team readiness and response during real incidents.
