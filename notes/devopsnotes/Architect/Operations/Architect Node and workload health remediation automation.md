# Architect: Node and workload health remediation automation

Automated health remediation ensures that infrastructure and workloads recover automatically from failures without manual intervention, improving uptime and reducing operational load.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Node Health
	- Monitors host or VM metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network, and system logs.
	- Detects failures like node crash, kernel panic, or resource exhaustion.
- ### Workload Health
	- Monitors containers, pods, or services for availability, readiness, and performance.
	- Detects failures such as OOMKilled pods, crashed containers, or unresponsive services.
- ### Automation Goal
	- Ensure self-healing systems that maintain service SLOs with minimal human intervention.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Kubernetes
	- **Liveness and Readiness Probes**
		- Detect unhealthy containers and restart automatically.
	- **Pod Auto-replacement**
		- Failed pods are rescheduled automatically by the Kubernetes control plane.
	- **Node Health Checks**
		- Node controller marks unhealthy nodes and evicts workloads for rescheduling.
- ### Cloud Infrastructure
	- **Auto-Healing Groups / Managed Instance Groups**
		- AWS Auto Scaling Groups and GCP MIGs replace failed instances automatically.
	- **Health Checks**
		- Load balancers detect unhealthy nodes and remove them from traffic rotation.
- ### Alerting & Automation
	- Integrate monitoring tools (Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog) with automation scripts or runbooks.
	- Example:
		- Alert: High memory usage → trigger automated pod scaling.
		- Alert: Disk full → spin up new node and drain old node.
- ### Self-Healing CI/CD Integration
	- Use pipelines to re-deploy failed workloads automatically.
	- Combine with immutable infrastructure for predictable recovery.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define Health Metrics
	- CPU, memory, response latency, error rates, disk I/O, custom app metrics.
- ### Automate Recovery
	- Restart pods, replace nodes, scale services automatically.
- ### Observability Integration
	- Alerts feed into dashboards for human oversight if automation fails.
- ### Fail-Safe Mechanisms
	- Implement rollback strategies for auto-remediation actions that fail.
- ### Testing & Simulation
	- Use chaos engineering to validate auto-healing mechanisms in staging.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Availability
	- Reduces MTTR by automatically fixing common failures.
	- Ensures high availability without constant manual intervention.
- ### Reliability
	- Supports SLO compliance and production reliability.
- ### Efficiency
	- Reduces alert fatigue and frees engineers for higher-value tasks.
