# Architect: Backup restore validation (frequency, retention, tested restores)

Backing up data is only half the story; validating that backups can be restored quickly and correctly ensures business continuity during failures.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Backup Frequency
	- Determines how often data is saved.
	- Trade-off between data loss risk (RPO) and resource usage.
	- Examples:
		- Hourly backups for high-transaction databases.
		- Daily backups for less critical systems.
- ### Retention Policy
	- Defines how long backups are kept.
	- Must satisfy regulatory and business requirements.
	- Example: 30-day daily backups, 12-month monthly backups.
- ### Restore Validation
	- Regularly test restoring from backups to ensure data integrity and recoverability.
	- Ensures RTO (Recovery Time Objective) targets are achievable.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Cloud Backup
	- **AWS**:
		- EBS snapshots with lifecycle policies.
		- RDS automated backups and snapshots.
	- **GCP**:
		- Cloud SQL automated backups and Storage snapshots.
	- **Azure**:
		- Recovery Services Vault for VMs, SQL, and storage accounts.
- ### Kubernetes
	- Etcd backups for cluster state.
	- Persistent volume backups via Velero or Kasten K10.
	- Automate snapshot scheduling and retention via CronJobs or backup operators.
- ### Testing Restores
	- Perform dry-run restores in staging to validate backup usability.
	- Periodically simulate disaster recovery scenarios.
	- Verify data integrity and completeness after restore.
- ### Automation & Monitoring
	- Automate backup creation, retention, and restore testing.
	- Monitor success/failure metrics and alert on anomalies.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define RPO & RTO
	- Align backup frequency and restore targets with business requirements.
- ### Immutable & Encrypted Backups
	- Protect backups against tampering or unauthorized access.
- ### Regular Restore Tests
	- At least quarterly or monthly depending on criticality.
- ### Centralized Monitoring
	- Track all backup jobs, completion status, and restore validation.
- ### Versioning & Retention
	- Keep multiple versions for long-term recovery.
	- Automatically purge expired backups.
- ### Documentation
	- Maintain runbooks for backup and restore procedures.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Continuity
	- Ensures business continuity during failures or disasters.
- ### Compliance
	- Reduces data loss risk and supports regulatory compliance.
- ### Confidence
	- Provides confidence in DR and high-availability strategies.
- ### Auditability
	- Enables auditable backup procedures for security and operations teams.
