# Architect: Cost visibility dashboards per team project

Providing cost visibility ensures teams understand their cloud spending, identify inefficiencies, and are accountable for resource usage.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Purpose
	- Track cloud and infrastructure costs across teams, projects, or environments.
	- Identify overspending, unused resources, and optimization opportunities.
- ### Scope
	- Multi-cloud or hybrid deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-prem).
	- Team-level and project-level granularity.
	- Integration with CI/CD pipelines, IaC, and Kubernetes usage.
- ### Key Objectives
	- Enable cost accountability for each team/project.
	- Provide actionable insights to optimize resource usage.
	- Support chargeback/showback models for budgeting.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Cloud-Native Dashboards
	- AWS Cost Explorer: visualize costs by account, service, or tag.
	- GCP Billing Reports: track costs by project or label.
	- Azure Cost Management: allocate costs per subscription or resource group.
- ### Tagging Strategy
	- Use consistent tags for projects, teams, environments, and cost centers.
	- Ensures dashboards can accurately attribute usage and costs.
- ### Third-Party Tools
	- Kubecost: tracks Kubernetes resource consumption and cost per namespace or deployment.
	- CloudHealth, CloudCheckr: multi-cloud cost visibility and optimization.
- ### Integration with DevOps Workflows
	- Link dashboards with CI/CD pipelines to track cost impact of deployments.
	- Enable alerts on cost spikes or anomalies.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define Clear Ownership
	- Assign cost accountability to teams or project owners.
- ### Granular Tagging
	- Enforce mandatory tagging for all resources via IaC templates or policies.
- ### Automated Alerts
	- Notify teams when budget thresholds or anomalous spend occurs.
- ### Historical Reporting
	- Track trends over time to identify waste and forecast budgets.
- ### Actionable Insights
	- Provide recommendations for rightsizing, idle resource cleanup, and spot/preemptible instance usage.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Accountability
	- Improves financial accountability and budgeting accuracy.
- ### Cost Reduction
	- Reduces wasted spend on idle or oversized resources.
- ### Decision Making
	- Enables data-driven decisions for scaling, environment creation, or cloud adoption.
- ### Incentives
	- Supports chargeback or showback models to incentivize responsible usage.
