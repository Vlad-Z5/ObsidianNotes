# Architect: Auto-scaling and scheduling for cost optimization

Auto-scaling and scheduling optimize infrastructure costs by matching resource usage with demand, reducing waste while maintaining performance and availability.

## 1. Core Concepts
- ### Auto-Scaling
	- Dynamically adjusts compute resources based on demand.
	- Reduces over-provisioning and ensures reliability under load.
- ### Scheduling
	- Start and stop non-critical workloads or environments based on time-of-day, usage patterns, or business hours.
	- Common for development, QA, or batch-processing workloads.
- ### Key Objectives
	- Lower cloud and operational costs.
	- Maintain performance and SLA adherence.
	- Increase resource efficiency without manual intervention.
## 2. Implementation Patterns
- ### Auto-Scaling Types
	- **Horizontal Scaling**
		- Add/remove instances or pods (e.g., AWS EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Kubernetes HPA).
	- **Vertical Scaling**
		- Adjust instance or container size dynamically (less common in cloud-native apps).
	- **Scheduled Scaling**
		- Predefine scaling actions during predictable load spikes.
- ### Cost-Aware Scheduling
	- Stop dev/test environments during off-hours using Lambda, Cloud Functions, or cron jobs.
	- Batch workloads run on spot/preemptible instances to minimize costs.
- ### Integration with Monitoring
	- Tie auto-scaling to metrics like CPU, memory, request rate, or custom SLIs.
	- Ensure scaling actions are aligned with application performance.
- ### Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Strategies
	- Leverage cross-cloud load balancing to scale workloads cost-effectively.
	- Consider bursting to cloud from on-prem resources when demand spikes.
## 3. Best Practices
- ### Define Metrics and Thresholds Carefully
	- Avoid oscillation or over-scaling by tuning metrics and cooldown periods.
- ### Use Spot/Preemptible Instances for Non-Critical Workloads
	- Significant cost savings without impacting critical SLAs.
- ### Monitor Utilization
	- Track underutilized resources for rightsizing or scheduling adjustments.
- ### Combine Auto-Scaling with Scheduling
	- Ensure environments scale down automatically when idle.
- ### Test Scaling Policies
	- Conduct load tests and chaos experiments to validate scaling behavior.
## 4. Operational Benefits
- ### Cost Reduction
	- Reduces cloud infrastructure costs by minimizing idle or oversized resources.
- ### Performance
	- Maintains application performance during demand spikes.
- ### Automation
	- Automates manual resource adjustments, reducing operational overhead.
- ### Planning
	- Supports predictable budgeting and capacity planning.
