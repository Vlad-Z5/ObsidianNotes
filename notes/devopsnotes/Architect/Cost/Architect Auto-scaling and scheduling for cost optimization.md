# Auto-scaling and scheduling for cost optimization

# Content from previous subtopic: [[Use of spot/preemptible instances where safe

Hint: automation to tear down, limits, preemptible instances, quotas, chargebacks.

How to handle DB schema migrations when deploys are frequent and rollback must be possible?
Hint: backward-compatible changes, feature flags, expand/contract pattern, dual-write avoidance.

Quick interviewer tactics & how to answer under pressure

Ask clarifying questions (scale, RTO/RPO, compliance). If they don’t answer, assume reasonable numbers and state them.

Speak in milestones: design → failure modes → remediation → validation.

Use diagrams (verbally) when time allows: say “imagine a diagram with …”.

When unsure, show principled tradeoffs rather than a single “perfect” solution.

If you want, I can:

Convert this into a one-page printable cheat sheet.

Generate 20 mock interview prompts with ideal bullet answers for practice.

Create a timed mock interview (I play interviewer, you answer).

Which of those next steps would you like?

ok i need the full scope of devops architect role

Got it — you want the full scope of what a DevOps Architect is expected to own, design, and influence.
This isn’t just a “senior DevOps engineer” with a fancier title — it’s a cross-cutting technical leadership role that spans architecture, governance, process, and culture.

DevOps Architect – Full Scope
1. Strategic Responsibilities
Area	Scope
Vision & Strategy	Define and maintain the organization’s DevOps roadmap aligning with business objectives.
DevOps Culture	Champion collaboration between Dev, Ops, QA, and Security; embed DevOps principles org-wide.
Governance & Standards	Create policies for CI/CD, IaC, observability, and security that balance agility with compliance.
Toolchain Strategy	Select, standardize, and integrate tools across the SDLC (build, test, deploy, monitor).
Cost Optimization	Architect for efficient cloud spend, implement cost visibility and governance.
2. Core Technical Domains
Infrastructure Architecture

Cloud Strategy: Multi-cloud/hybrid design, landing zones, account structures, VPC/subnetting strategies.

IaC: Standardize on Terraform, Pulumi, or CloudFormation with modular, reusable blueprints.

Scalability: Auto-scaling patterns (infra and app), capacity planning.

Resilience & DR: Cross-region replication, failover strategies, RTO/RPO adherence.
