Virtual Private Cloud allows you to provision a logically isolated section of AWS cloud

- **Subnets:** Segments within a VPC, can be public or private
- **Route Tables:** Control traffic routing between subnets and to the internet
- **Internet Gateway (IGW):** Enables internet access for public subnets
- **NAT Gateway:** Allows private subnet instances to access the internet securely
- **Security Groups:** Virtual firewalls controlling inbound/outbound traffic for instances
- **Network ACLs:** Stateless firewalls controlling traffic at subnet level
- **Elastic IPs:** Static public IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing
- **VPC Peering:** Connects two VPCs privately without traversing the internet
- **Endpoints:** Private connection to AWS services without internet traffic
