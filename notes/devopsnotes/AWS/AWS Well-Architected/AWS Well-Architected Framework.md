# Framework Implementation Methodology

**Phase 1: Assessment and Discovery**
- Conduct Well-Architected Review (WAR) using official AWS tools
- Identify architectural gaps and risks across all six pillars
- Prioritize improvements based on business impact and technical complexity
- Establish baseline metrics for measuring improvement

**Phase 2: Strategic Planning**
- Develop comprehensive remediation roadmap with clear timelines
- Align architectural improvements with business objectives and budgets
- Establish cross-functional teams with clear ownership and accountability
- Create governance processes for ongoing architectural health

**Phase 3: Implementation and Optimization**
- Execute improvements in controlled iterations with risk mitigation
- Implement continuous monitoring and alerting for architectural health
- Establish feedback loops for ongoing optimization and learning
- Scale successful patterns across the organization

## Real-World Implementation Examples

### E-commerce Platform Transformation
**Challenge**: Legacy e-commerce platform with frequent outages during peak traffic
