# AWS Well-Architected Framework - Pillar 2: Security

## Strategic Context

Security represents both risk mitigation and competitive advantage. Organizations with mature security practices reduce breach probability by 95% while enabling faster product development through embedded security processes.

### Business Impact of Security Excellence
- **Risk Reduction**: 95% reduction in security breach probability
- **Compliance Efficiency**: 60% reduction in audit preparation time
- **Development Velocity**: 40% faster feature delivery through automated security
- **Customer Trust**: Improved customer retention and acquisition
- **Regulatory Advantage**: Faster entry into regulated markets

### Security Design Principles
1. **Implement a strong identity foundation**: Principle of least privilege and centralized identity management
2. **Apply security at all layers**: Defense in depth with multiple security controls
3. **Automate security best practices**: Reduce human error through automation
4. **Protect data in transit and at rest**: Comprehensive encryption strategies
5. **Keep people away from data**: Minimize direct access to sensitive information
6. **Prepare for security events**: Incident response and forensic capabilities

## Core Principles and Best Practices

### Defense in Depth

**Identity and Access Management**
Implement comprehensive IAM strategies with least-privilege access, multi-factor authentication, and regular access reviews. Use identity providers and single sign-on solutions to centralize access control.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/DevTeamRole"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/dev/*",
      "Condition": {
        "Bool": {
          "aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": "true"
        },
        "DateGreaterThan": {
          "aws:CurrentTime": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Network Security**
Design network architectures with multiple security layers including firewalls, intrusion detection, and network segmentation. Implement zero-trust networking principles where practical.

```yaml
# Example: Network Security Groups
apiVersion: v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: deny-all-ingress
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend-to-backend
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: backend
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: frontend
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
```

**Data Protection**
Establish comprehensive data protection including encryption at rest and in transit, key management, and data classification. Implement data loss prevention and regular security assessments.

```terraform
# Example: S3 Bucket with Encryption
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure_bucket" {
  bucket = "company-secure-data"

  server_side_encryption_configuration {
    rule {
      apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
        kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.bucket_key.arn
        sse_algorithm     = "aws:kms"
      }
      bucket_key_enabled = true
    }
  }

  versioning {
    enabled = true
  }

  logging {
    target_bucket = aws_s3_bucket.access_logs.id
    target_prefix = "access-logs/"
  }

  public_access_block {
    block_public_acls       = true
    block_public_policy     = true
    ignore_public_acls      = true
    restrict_public_buckets = true
  }
}
```

### Security Automation

**Continuous Security Testing**
Integrate security testing into CI/CD pipelines including static analysis, dynamic testing, and dependency scanning. Automate security policy enforcement and compliance checking.

```yaml
# Example: Security Pipeline
name: Security Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Static Analysis
        uses: github/super-linter@v4
        env:
          VALIDATE_ALL_CODEBASE: true
          DEFAULT_BRANCH: main
      
      - name: Dependency Check
        uses: dependency-check/Dependency-Check_Action@main
        with:
          project: 'my-project'
          path: '.'
          format: 'ALL'
      
      - name: Container Scan
        run: |
          docker build -t myapp:latest .
          trivy image myapp:latest
      
      - name: Infrastructure Security
        run: |
          tfsec .
          checkov -d . --framework terraform
```

**Threat Detection and Response**
Implement automated threat detection using machine learning and behavioral analysis. Establish security information and event management (SIEM) systems with automated response capabilities.

```yaml
# Example: AWS GuardDuty Integration
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: security-monitoring
data:
  guardduty-findings.json: |
    {
      "rules": [
        {
          "name": "HighSeverityFinding",
          "condition": "severity >= 7.0",
          "actions": [
            "isolate_instance",
            "notify_security_team",
            "create_incident"
          ]
        },
        {
          "name": "UnauthorizedAPICall",
          "condition": "type == 'UnauthorizedAPICall'",
          "actions": [
            "disable_credentials",
            "audit_account_activity"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```

### Compliance and Governance

**Policy as Code**
Implement security policies as code to ensure consistent application across environments. Use tools like Open Policy Agent or cloud-native policy engines.

```rego
# Example: OPA Policy for Kubernetes
package kubernetes.admission

import data.kubernetes.namespaces

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
    not starts_with(input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image, "registry.company.com/")
    msg := "Container images must be from approved registry"
}

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.containers[_].securityContext.privileged == true
    msg := "Privileged containers are not allowed"
}

deny[msg] {
    input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
    input.request.object.spec.hostNetwork == true
    msg := "Host network access is not allowed"
}
```

**Audit and Compliance**
Establish continuous compliance monitoring and automated audit preparation. Implement comprehensive logging and audit trails for all system activities.

```terraform
# Example: Comprehensive Audit Trail
resource "aws_cloudtrail" "main" {
  name           = "company-audit-trail"
  s3_bucket_name = aws_s3_bucket.audit_logs.bucket

  event_selector {
    read_write_type                 = "All"
    include_management_events       = true
    exclude_management_event_sources = []

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::S3::Object"
      values = ["arn:aws:s3:::sensitive-data/*"]
    }

    data_resource {
      type   = "AWS::Lambda::Function"
      values = ["*"]
    }
  }

  insight_selector {
    insight_type = "ApiCallRateInsight"
  }

  is_multi_region_trail = true
  enable_log_file_validation = true
  
  cloud_watch_logs_group_arn = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.audit.arn
  cloud_watch_logs_role_arn  = aws_iam_role.cloudtrail_role.arn
}
```

## Security Anti-Patterns and Solutions

### Anti-Pattern: Security as an Afterthought
**Problem**: Adding security controls after development completion
**Solution**: Shift-left security with integrated development workflows

```yaml
# Example: Secure Development Lifecycle
stages:
  - name: threat-modeling
    tools: [Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, OWASP Threat Dragon]
  - name: secure-coding
    tools: [SonarQube, Checkmarx, Veracode]
  - name: dependency-scanning
    tools: [Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, Retire.js]
  - name: container-scanning
    tools: [Trivy, Clair, Twistlock]
  - name: infrastructure-scanning
    tools: [Terraform Security Scanner, CloudFormation Linter]
  - name: runtime-protection
    tools: [AWS GuardDuty, Falco, Sysdig]
```

### Anti-Pattern: Overprivileged Access
**Problem**: Granting excessive permissions for convenience
**Solution**: Implement least-privilege access with just-in-time permissions

```python
# Example: Dynamic IAM Role Assignment
import boto3
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def grant_temporary_access(user_id, resource_arn, duration_hours=4):
    """Grant temporary access to specific resources"""
    
    policy_document = {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": ["s3:GetObject", "s3:PutObject"],
                "Resource": resource_arn,
                "Condition": {
                    "DateLessThan": {
                        "aws:CurrentTime": (datetime.utcnow() + 
                                          timedelta(hours=duration_hours)).isoformat()
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    
    iam = boto3.client('iam')
    
    # Create temporary policy
    policy_name = f"temp-access-{user_id}-{int(datetime.now().timestamp())}"
    response = iam.create_policy(
        PolicyName=policy_name,
        PolicyDocument=json.dumps(policy_document),
        Description=f"Temporary access for {user_id}"
    )
    
    # Attach to user
    iam.attach_user_policy(
        UserName=user_id,
        PolicyArn=response['Policy']['Arn']
    )
    
    return response['Policy']['Arn']
```

### Anti-Pattern: Weak Secrets Management
**Problem**: Hardcoded secrets and weak key management
**Solution**: Centralized secrets management with rotation

```terraform
# Example: Secrets Management with Rotation
resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "db_password" {
  name                    = "production/database/password"
  description             = "Database password with automatic rotation"
  recovery_window_in_days = 0

  replica {
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_rotation" "db_password" {
  secret_id           = aws_secretsmanager_secret.db_password.id
  rotation_lambda_arn = aws_lambda_function.rotation.arn

  rotation_rules {
    automatically_after_days = 30
  }
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "rotation" {
  filename         = "rotation_function.zip"
  function_name    = "rds-password-rotation"
  role            = aws_iam_role.rotation_role.arn
  handler         = "lambda_function.lambda_handler"
  runtime         = "python3.9"

  environment {
    variables = {
      SECRETS_MANAGER_ENDPOINT = "https://secretsmanager.${var.region}.amazonaws.com"
    }
  }
}
```
