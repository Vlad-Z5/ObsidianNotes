- **Purpose:** Optional stateless firewall for controlling traffic in and out of subnets  
- Deny everything by default
- **Stateless:** Responses must be explicitly allowed by rules  
- **Applies To:** Subnets (not individual instances)  
- **Rule Evaluation:** Numbered rules evaluated in order; lowest number first (1-32766)
- **Default NACL:** Allows all inbound and outbound traffic 
- **Custom NACL:** Deny all by default unless specified  
- **Supports:** Allow and deny rules (unlike Security Groups which only allow)  
- **Use Case:** Fine-grained subnet-level control, blacklist IPs, etc.
