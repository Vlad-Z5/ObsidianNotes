# AWS CodePipeline

> **Service Type:** CI/CD Orchestration | **Tier:** CI/CD and Automation | **Global/Regional:** Regional

## Overview

AWS CodePipeline is a continuous delivery service that automates build, test, and deploy phases of your release process. It provides visual workflow management for end-to-end software delivery pipelines.

## DevOps Use Cases

### Application Delivery
- **Web application deployment** with automated testing and rollback
- **Microservices pipelines** with service-specific deployment stages
- **Mobile app CI/CD** with device testing and app store deployment
- **Multi-environment promotion** from dev to staging to production

### Infrastructure Automation
- **Infrastructure as Code** deployments using CloudFormation/CDK
- **Configuration management** with Ansible, Chef, or Puppet
- **Security compliance** with automated security scanning
- **Multi-account deployments** across AWS Organizations

### Advanced Workflows
- **Blue-green deployments** with traffic shifting validation
- **Canary releases** with automated rollback on metrics
- **Feature branch builds** with parallel environment provisioning
- **Cross-region deployments** for disaster recovery and global reach

## Pipeline Architecture

### Pipeline Types

#### Build Pipelines
- **Flow:** Source → Build → Test → Deploy
- **Artifacts:** Code compilation, dependency resolution, packaging
- **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, security scans
- **Deployment:** Application deployment to target environments

#### Infrastructure Pipelines
- **Flow:** Source → Validate → Deploy → Test
- **Templates:** CloudFormation, Terraform, CDK
- **Validation:** Template linting, cost estimation, security analysis
- **Testing:** Infrastructure validation, compliance checks

### Pipeline Components

#### Stages
- **Sequential Execution:** Stages run one after another
- **Gates:** Manual approval or automated validation points
- **Parallel Actions:** Multiple actions within a stage
- **Failure Handling:** Stop pipeline on failure or continue

#### Actions
- **Source Actions:** GitHub, CodeCommit, S3, ECR
- **Build Actions:** CodeBuild, Jenkins, TeamCity
- **Test Actions:** CodeBuild, Device Farm, third-party tools
- **Deploy Actions:** CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, ECS, Lambda
- **Invoke Actions:** Lambda functions, SNS notifications

#### Artifacts
- **Input/Output:** Artifacts passed between actions
- **Storage:** S3 bucket managed by CodePipeline
- **Encryption:** KMS encryption for sensitive artifacts
- **Retention:** Configurable artifact retention policies

## Key Features

### Visual Pipeline Editor
- **Drag-and-drop interface** for pipeline creation
- **Real-time execution tracking** with stage status
- **Pipeline visualization** showing flow and dependencies
- **Execution history** with detailed logs and timings

### Integration Capabilities
- **AWS Services:** Native integration with CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation
- **Third-party Tools:** GitHub, Jenkins, Jira, Slack
- **Custom Actions:** Lambda functions for custom logic
- **Webhooks:** External triggers for pipeline execution

### Advanced Features
- **Pipeline templates** for standardized workflows
- **Cross-region deployments** for global applications
- **CloudWatch Events** integration for automated triggering
- **Variable propagation** between pipeline stages
- **Conditional execution** based on parameters or conditions

## Pipeline Patterns

### Simple Web Application
```yaml
Pipeline:
  - Source: GitHub repository
  - Build: CodeBuild (npm install, npm test, npm run build)
  - Deploy: S3 + CloudFront distribution
```

### Microservice with Containers
```yaml
Pipeline:
  - Source: CodeCommit repository
  - Build: CodeBuild (Docker build, push to ECR)
  - Test: CodeBuild (integration tests)
  - Deploy: ECS service update
```

### Infrastructure as Code
```yaml
Pipeline:
  - Source: CloudFormation templates
  - Validate: cfn-lint, CloudFormation validate
  - Deploy: CloudFormation stack update
  - Test: Infrastructure validation scripts
```

### Multi-Environment Promotion
```yaml
Pipeline:
  - Source: Application code
  - Build: Compile and package
  - Deploy-Dev: Automatic deployment to development
  - Test-Dev: Automated testing in dev environment
  - Approval: Manual approval gate
  - Deploy-Prod: Deployment to production
  - Monitor: CloudWatch dashboard and alarms
```

## Best Practices

### Pipeline Design
- **Fail fast:** Put quick validations early in pipeline
- **Parallel execution:** Run independent actions in parallel
- **Artifact management:** Minimize artifact size and scope
- **Idempotent operations:** Ensure deployments can be safely repeated

### Security
- **IAM roles:** Use service roles with least privilege
- **Artifact encryption:** Enable KMS encryption for sensitive data
- **Secret management:** Use Parameter Store or Secrets Manager
- **Cross-account roles:** Secure multi-account deployments

### Monitoring
- **CloudWatch metrics:** Monitor pipeline success rates and duration
- **CloudTrail logging:** Audit pipeline execution and changes
- **SNS notifications:** Alert on pipeline failures or approvals
- **Custom metrics:** Application-specific deployment metrics

### Cost Optimization
- **On-demand builds:** Use CodeBuild for elastic build capacity
- **Efficient testing:** Optimize test execution time
- **Artifact cleanup:** Implement retention policies
- **Resource scheduling:** Schedule non-critical pipelines during off-hours

## Integration Examples

### GitHub Integration
- **Webhooks:** Automatic pipeline triggers on push/PR
- **OAuth tokens:** Secure GitHub access
- **Branch filtering:** Pipeline execution based on branch patterns
- **Status updates:** Pipeline results posted back to GitHub

### Slack Integration
- **Approval notifications:** Manual approval requests
- **Status updates:** Pipeline execution notifications
- **Deployment announcements:** Successful deployment alerts
- **Failure alerts:** Immediate notification on pipeline failures

### JIRA Integration
- **Ticket creation:** Automatic ticket creation on failures
- **Deployment tracking:** Link deployments to JIRA issues
- **Release notes:** Automatic release note generation
- **Approval workflows:** JIRA-based approval processes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission errors:** Check IAM roles and policies for all services
- **Artifact corruption:** Verify artifact integrity and S3 permissions
- **Build failures:** Review CloudWatch logs for detailed error information
- **Deployment timeouts:** Adjust timeout settings for long-running operations

### Debugging Techniques
- **CloudWatch logs:** Detailed execution logs for each action
- **Pipeline execution history:** Compare successful vs failed executions
- **Service limits:** Check AWS service limits for concurrent executions
- **CloudTrail events:** API-level troubleshooting for permission issues

### Performance Optimization
- **Build caching:** Use CodeBuild caching for faster builds
- **Parallel stages:** Optimize pipeline structure for parallel execution
- **Resource sizing:** Right-size CodeBuild environments
- **Artifact optimization:** Minimize artifact transfer time
