### Microservices Architecture
**Service Decomposition:**
- Break applications into small, independent services
- Each service has specific business responsibility
- Services communicate via APIs or message queues
- Independent deployment and scaling of services

**API Gateway:**

- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and throttling

### Event-Driven Architecture
**Asynchronous Communication:**
- Services communicate through events and messages
- Loose coupling between system components
- Better resilience and fault tolerance
- Scalable processing of high-volume events

**Message Queues and Topics:**
- Reliable message delivery between services
- Buffer for handling traffic spikes
- Dead letter queues for failed message processing
- Event streaming for real-time data processing

## Cloud Security Fundamentals

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
**Core principles:**
- Principle of least privilege access
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Regular access reviews and audits

**Implementation:**
- Service accounts for applications
- Temporary credentials and token-based access
- API keys and secret management

## Cost Management and Optimization

### Pricing Models
**On-Demand Pricing:**
